At TTS, [Google Docs/Sheets/Slides]({% page "/google-drive/" %}) is our
preferred tool for documents/spreadsheets/presentations, since it has built-in
records retention, collaboration, sharing, importing and exporting of Office
files, etc.

In normal day-to-day operations, working on projects for GSA, you will probably
never need Microsoft Office. The most common case for needing Office is if
another agency is unable to use web-based productivity tools like GSA's G Suite.

If you only need Office temporarily, you can access it right away through
[VDI](https://vdi.anywhere.gsa.gov). To get a license on your machine, you will
need to put in a request.

## Requesting a license

1. [Open a Software request through ServiceNow](https://gsa.servicenowservices.com/sp/?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=1bfdfdca78d3a400ce3ddff91a64940b)
1. For `Software Name`, select
    * for Macs: `Microsoft Office Suite (Word, Excel, PowerPoint) (*GSA* - MAC Client only) 2019: Approved-Preferred`
    * for PCs: `Microsoft Office Suite (Word, Excel, PowerPoint) (*GSA* - WIN Client only) 2019: Approved-Preferred`
