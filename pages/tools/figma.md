You can get started [immediately](https://www.figma.com) with a free account using your GSA email login credentials (**do not sign in with SSO**), and you’ll receive an email from Figma to verify your account. In order to request access to TTS team(s)/workspace(s), you'll need to email the 18F design tool owner. Ask your supervisor who's currently in this role. Visit {% slack_channel "figma" %} on Slack for help and sharing tips.

## Plugins

Figma plugins are okay to use and don’t require approval as long as they don't integrate with other SaaS products (e.g. Google Drive) and are self-contained within the Figma environment. Otherwise, each Figma plugin is treated like a [new software request](https://handbook.tts.gsa.gov/software/), and must undergo review by GSA IT review. If you’re unsure whether a plugin will require approval, reach out in {% slack_channel "figma" %} on Slack with any questions.
