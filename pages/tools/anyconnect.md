Cisco AnyConnect is the VPN client that we use to connect to GSA's network. See
[how to connect using your PIV card](https://gsa.servicenowservices.com/sp/?id=kb_article&sys_id=6d6753d1dbb73b84c3d674608c96195c),
or if you're having PIV issues,
[using SecureAuth](https://gsa.servicenowservices.com/sp/?id=kb_article&sys_id=22191902db10774058c2fd721f9619f5).

To speed things up a bit, use a `GSA Access Card Login` (PIV login)
configuration and set `Start VPN when AnyConnect is started` in AnyConnect’s
preferences to automatically initiate the login process when the application is
launched.
