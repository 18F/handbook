We use Google Groups to manage team and interest-based email distribution lists
and listservs. A list of listservs and groups TTS uses is
[here]({% page "/working-groups-and-guilds-101/" %}). Digital.gov also maintains
a list of
[government Communities of Practice](https://digital.gov/communities/).

## Create a Google Group

See
[the instructions in the GSA Knowledge Base](https://gsa.servicenowservices.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0024704).

## Manage a Google Group

To find the groups that you are in and manage any groups where you are an admin,
visit [My Groups][my-groups].

## How are GSA Google Groups different than regular Google Groups?

GSA Google Groups work a little differently than regular Google Groups.

People outside GSA can't access GSA Google Groups via the Google Groups website,
but can still receive email if added to the group directly. Similarly, you can't
access public Google Groups via the Google Groups website with your GSA email,
but you can still receive email if added to the group directly.

If you're using the group with non-GSA folks, you're probably better off using a
[listserv instead](https://listserv.gsa.gov/). If a non-GSA public group already
exists, it might be better to join that group instead.

## How do I configure my GSA Google Group for non-GSA users?

To adjust group permissions so non-GSA people can join your Google Group, click
on your [Google Group][my-groups], then click "Group settings" on the left
navigation. Enable or select these options:

- People outside the organization can be members (ON)
- Allow email posting

To invite non-GSA folks to your group, use **add** instead of **invite**. You
will need to manage their settings on their behalf e.g. to receive daily
digests.

## How can the group receive email from anyone on the web?

To allow email from any non-members on the web, go to your [Google
Group][my-groups] and select "Group settings" on the left navigation. Enable
these settings:

- Who can post (Anyone on the web)
- Allow email posting

## Tips

- While you can receive emails via the Google Group, be aware that your response
  will come from your main email account. If you're an admin for the group,
  however, you can select the group address when you are composing a response.
- You can subscribe to Google Groups with the following RSS feed URL:
  `https://groups.google.com/forum/feed/<GROUP_NAME>/msgs/rss.xml`
