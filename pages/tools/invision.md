[18F Design]({% page "/design/" %}) uses
[InVision](https://www.invisionapp.com/) for prototyping and group online
critique. Using InVision at GSA comes with one specific rule: we cannot use any
cloud-syncing features. Please don't use InVision Cloud or InVision Sync.

If you are a member of the 18F Design team, once you have requested and received
an InVision license, tell your supervisor that you have an account and are ready
to be added to the "18F Design Team"
[group](https://gsa.invisionapp.com/d/main?origin=v7#/company/teams) in
InVision. This will enable you to see prototypes from all of our projects. When
making your own prototypes in the future, always add this team as a
collaborator.

## Offboarding

[Transfer ownership of your prototypes](https://support.invisionapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/203730565-How-do-I-transfer-my-prototype-to-another-account-)
to your supervisor or to another project team member so that they won't be lost
once your account is deactivated.
