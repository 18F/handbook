Visual designers often need
[Creative Cloud (CC)](https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud.html) for access to
high-powered vector control in Illustrator, image editing in Photoshop, print
layout in InDesign, or video-editing tools. You can request either:

- Acrobat Pro
- Photoshop
- The full Creative Cloud Suite

by submitting
[a Software Request through the GSA IT Help Desk](https://gsa.servicenowservices.com/sp/?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=1bfdfdca78d3a400ce3ddff91a64940b).
Make sure to specify that you are on a Mac. Note that licenses are limited, so
please don't request access unless you really do need it for your work.
