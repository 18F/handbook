_a.k.a. G Suite_

Google Drive is a cloud storage and file backup system. We use Google Drive to
keep track of our project work and templates as well as collaborate on
documents, presentations, and spreadsheets. You don't need to install anything
to use our Google Drive.

## Permissions and sharing

- Everything in Google Drive can be FOIA’ed.
- You can share files with the entire TTS team by adding
  [tts@gsa.gov](mailto:tts@gsa.gov),
  [opp-team@gsa.gov](mailto:opp-team@gsa.gov), or
  [18f-team@gsa.gov](mailto:18f-team@gsa.gov) in the Share menu.
- You can share files with any GSA employee — but don't default to sharing with
  _all_ of GSA. GSA will change your permissions if they are too open, and files
  that contain sensitive information will also be blocked via
  [Cloudlock](https://insite.gsa.gov/employee-resources/information-technology/do-it-yourself-self-help/google-g-suite-apps/sharing-securely-in-google/cloudlock).
- Disable the notification email if you don’t wish to bring it to the team’s
  attention right away.
- You can create and share whole folders; new files in a folder auto-inherit the
  sharing settings.
- Most business units have a team folder in Drive to faciliate collaboration.
- You can't publish files to the web or share them with the public, even just to
  view; only GSA or specific users.
- If another agency employs Google Docs, documents can be shared directly with
  them.
- If the agency does not currently use Google Drive, agency staff may be able to
  create a google account using their work email
  [by using this form](https://accounts.google.com/SignUpWithoutGmail?hl=en).
  Staff may alternatively be able to create a GSA Affiliated Customer Account
  (GACA). This will allow you to share Drive files with them. Note that GACA
  accounts are intended to allow us to share Drive files with other agency
  staff, not for them to create those files themselves. Any files they create in
  Drive through their GACA accounts are NOT within the boundaries of the FedRamp
  ATO. You should refer to these
  [internal instructions for setting up a GACA account](https://insite.gsa.gov/portal/content/517805?term=gaca)
  and send agency staff
  [these PDF instructions](https://insite.gsa.gov/cdnstatic/insite/GACA__GSAAffiliatedCustomerAccounts_May_2016-v2.pdf).
  If Staff aren't able to access
  [this form](https://accounts.google.com/SignUpWithoutGmail?hl=en), that likely
  means their agency expressly blocks Google Drive.
- If you create a Google form that is intended for employees of another agency,
  keep in mind that in a few agencies, Google Forms are blocked. Among the
  largest agencies that are known to currently block Forms are: Department of
  Homeland Security (DHS), Veterans Affairs (VA), and Executive Office of the
  President (EOP). In the case that you intend to involve those agencies in an
  initiative where a Google Form is being used, it's smart to create a version
  in another format, like a Word doc or fillable PDF.

## Usage

- **Abide by [the TTS Code of Conduct]({% page "/code-of-conduct" %}).** If you
  see anyone violating our Code of Conduct, see the reporting section.
- When you’re at work, make sure you're using your GSA account and not your
  private account, especially when working with outside partners. Official GSA
  documents must live in your GSA Google Drive for compliance reasons.
- Visit [the 18F brand guide](https://brand.18f.gov/templates/) for default 18F
  document styles/templates.

### Google Drive Tips

- The Shift-Z command allows you to add folders to "My Drive" (shortcut) and to
  other folders at the same time - which is great for organizing documents in
  different ways.
- **Finding recent documents** To find recently opened documents, use
  [this link](https://drive.google.com/drive/recent), which you can find by
  clicking on the "AZ" button and selecting "Last opened by me."
- To find and access things you use frequently, you can
  ["Add to My Drive"](https://support.google.com/drive/answer/2375057?hl=en) or
  star the folder or document.
- Searching in Drive goes through all of the files that have been shared with
  you.
- If a folder looks empty, try refreshing your browser a few times. :shrug:

### Google Form Tips

Google forms handle a variety of use cases like account requests, sign ups,
contact us, feedback, bug reporting, support requests, data calls, and project
submittals.

- Link or embed you form on a government website using
  [iframes](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_iframe.asp).
- Let users know upfront how much time it will take to fill out your form.
- Limit your form to 5-10 fields or 2-3 sections when possible to keep user
  burden low.
- Reassure users your form is work-related by
  [using the organization's color scheme and logo](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1xjiJCyJNFzWTieg8yUamntPeznADyfn8ZgIwHnM8PBg/viewform?edit_requested=true).
- You can
  [limit your form to users with a .gov or .mil email address](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSePimoF0RkiCP62BSIL_yj0yMXEUePNJ9AabPJqq1Xzbp_GVg/viewform);
  see how in
  [these text validation instructions](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/3378864?hl=en).
- There's a lot you can do with
  [Google Form's native capabilities](https://support.google.com/a/users/answer/9302965?hl=en)
  so try to avoid adding backend logic. If you need more, then use
  [Google Apps Script](#google-apps-script).
- Create a form response spreadsheet before publishing your form, to ensure your
  data is in the format you need.
- If you want users to select one response to your form question, format your
  question as a drop down rather than multiple choice, and your data will
  already be categorized for you in the response spreadsheet.
- Avoid asking users for data you can otherwise match or derive from an existing
  field(s).
- Set up email notifications to trigger by new form submissions or edits to the
  response spreadsheet, to cut down your response time.

## Security

If you're using a non-Google service and it requests access to your GSA Google
Drive (such as to enable an integration feature), please deny that request. In
other words, don't grant OAuth access to GSA Google Drive.
[Here's a blog post on this policy](https://18f.gsa.gov/2016/05/13/how-18f-handles-information-security-and-third-party-applications/).
To ensure no access is enabled, you can check
[Google's list of "Apps connected to your account"](https://security.google.com/settings/security/permissions),
expand each item, and look for the Google Drive icon. Here's an example of what
an OAuth access request might look like:

{% image "_img/google-drive/google-drive-oauth.png" "don't click "allow"" %}

## Local editing

The [Google Drive](https://support.google.com/drive/answer/7329379?hl=en)
(formerly Drive File Stream) app can be used for local editing of files on
Drive.
[InSite page.](https://insite.gsa.gov/employee-resources/information-technology/do-it-yourself-self-help/google-g-suite-apps/google-drive-and-shared-drive?term=drive%20file%20stream#Drive%20File%20Stream)

If you get a "can't load" error, try
[clearing the cache](https://remarkablemark.medium.com/how-to-clear-google-drive-cache-abf9efc6089e).

## API keys

To access GSA's
[Google Workspace APIs](https://developers.google.com/workspace), submit a
[Generic Request in ServiceNow](https://gsa.servicenowservices.com/sp/?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=7a09e6672b523000a6e7a73319da1554)
explaining what you're trying to do. Since GSA Google Workspace is
[categorized]({% page "/launching-software/lifecycle/#system-categorization" %})
as a Moderate system, they may not allow access from a Low system.

## Google Apps Script

See
[information on InSite](https://insite.gsa.gov/employee-resources/information-technology/do-it-yourself-self-help/google-workspace/google-app-scripts).
