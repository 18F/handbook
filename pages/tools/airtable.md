[Airtable](https://airtable.com/) is a cloud-based tool that allows users to organize their workflow, data, and records in a flexible and visually appealing way without the need for any coding. **Licenses are now available for all TTS employees**. 

### How to Request a License 

TTS employees can obtain a free, read-only license by simply making a request via the [#airtable-smartsheet](https://app.slack.com/client/E011QM4UN3G/C6YNTUPS9?space=1) Slack channel. Tech Operations will fulfill the request by granting the employee a read-only license. Read-only users can view but not edit or comment on everything in the workspace, base, or interface. 

Administrators, owners, creators, and editors all require paid licenses. TTS has a limited number of paid licenses available so please ensure you have a job-related need before requesting a paid license. You will need an email from your supervisor complete with the following information forwarded to tts-tech-operations@gsa.gov for your request to be approved. Your [Airtable group manager](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lbf8mkD4eJuKlRg5Uw2r1FHx3YCAiZp7P9qcoEG6rnk/edit?gid=0#gid=0) can help you if you have questions about any of these items:

* The [workspace](https://airtable.com/appQbn3D4GMM8SD0O/pag7cdXd49Dat3bBw?detail=eyJwYWdlSWQiOiJwYWdxTEdwRFlFYktubXpMaiIsInJvd0lkIjoicmVjSVZzTU82QVkxUVhnbjEiLCJzaG93Q29tbWVudHMiOmZhbHNlLCJxdWVyeU9yaWdpbkhpbnQiOm51bGx9) you would like to be invited to initially
* The level of access you need to the above workspace: owner, creator, editor, or viewer
* A brief justification for your request (be mindful that each Airtable editor seat costs TTS nearly $800 per year)
* Please ensure to copy your supervisor on the forwarded email to Tech Operations.
* You or your supervisor may make a request on behalf of a group.

You will automatically be given a read-only license if proper justification is not provided and/or your supervisor is not copied on the email.

If your team is new to Airtable and doesn’t have a group manager yet, reach out to ethan.heppner@gsa.gov to get your team’s initial workspace set up. Group managers are responsible for managing access to their workspace, which is similar to a Google Drive, but for your Airtable [bases](https://airtable.com/appQbn3D4GMM8SD0O/pag7cdXd49Dat3bBw?detail=eyJwYWdlSWQiOiJwYWdxTEdwRFlFYktubXpMaiIsInJvd0lkIjoicmVjVVYxVFpnSm5OcDFuUngiLCJzaG93Q29tbWVudHMiOmZhbHNlLCJxdWVyeU9yaWdpbkhpbnQiOm51bGx9).

### Airtable Administration 

Tech Operations serves as the enterprise admins and can override all permissions to add/delete/modify the user’s license type. We understand there are situations where users will only need a temporary paid seat to complete specific assignments. For this reason, we will perform quarterly audits to ensure we stay within the contractual license limit. Tech Operations will downgrade inactive users with paid seats to read-only seats. If TTS is still over the paid threshold after the inactive users license type is changed, then we will reach out to the group managers to obtain a list of users to downgrade.


### Usage Requirements 

Airtable has an Authorization to Operate (ATO) at FIPS 199 Low Impact Level; therefore, sensitive data such as personal identifiable information (PII) and controlled unclassified information (CUI) is not allowed. In addition, TTS is only authorized to give view-only access to partner agencies due the uncertainty of their ATO statuses. Other GSA Components are covered under the GSA ATO but should procure their own licenses. More detailed privacy and security guidance can be found [here](https://airtable.com/appQbn3D4GMM8SD0O/pagaDV7VWDAjLdAC0).
