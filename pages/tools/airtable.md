[Airtable](https://airtable.com/) is a cloud-based tool that allows users to organize their workflow, data, and records in a flexible and visually appealing way without the need for any coding. **Licenses are now available for all TTS employees**. 

### How to Request a License 

TTS employees can obtain a free, read-only license by making a request to tts-tech-operations@gsa.gov. Read-only users can view but not edit or comment on anything in the workspace, base, or interface. 

Commenting, editing, and creating will require a paid editor seat. TTS has a limited number of paid seats available so please ensure you have a job-related need before requesting a paid license. You will need an email from your supervisor complete with the following information forwarded to tts-tech-operations@gsa.gov for your request to be approved.

* A brief justification for your request (being mindful of Airtable's [per seat pricing](https://airtable.com/pricing))
* Please ensure to copy your supervisor on the forwarded email to Tech Operations.
* You or your supervisor may make a request on behalf of a group.

You will automatically be given a read-only license if proper justification is not provided and/or your supervisor is not copied on the email.

The Tech Operations team is responsible for granting initial access to Airtable, but individuals are responsible for [managing access](https://airtable.com/appQbn3D4GMM8SD0O/pag7cdXd49Dat3bBw?detail=eyJwYWdlSWQiOiJwYWdxTEdwRFlFYktubXpMaiIsInJvd0lkIjoicmVjZGlYTDFtVTB2WFlhRzIiLCJzaG93Q29tbWVudHMiOmZhbHNlLCJxdWVyeU9yaWdpbkhpbnQiOm51bGx9) to their [workspaces](https://airtable.com/appQbn3D4GMM8SD0O/pag7cdXd49Dat3bBw?detail=eyJwYWdlSWQiOiJwYWdxTEdwRFlFYktubXpMaiIsInJvd0lkIjoicmVjSVZzTU82QVkxUVhnbjEiLCJzaG93Q29tbWVudHMiOmZhbHNlLCJxdWVyeU9yaWdpbkhpbnQiOm51bGx9) and [bases](https://airtable.com/appQbn3D4GMM8SD0O/pag7cdXd49Dat3bBw?detail=eyJwYWdlSWQiOiJwYWdxTEdwRFlFYktubXpMaiIsInJvd0lkIjoicmVjVVYxVFpnSm5OcDFuUngiLCJzaG93Q29tbWVudHMiOmZhbHNlLCJxdWVyeU9yaWdpbkhpbnQiOm51bGx9) just as they would manage access to their Google Drives and documents.

### Airtable Administration 

Tech Operations serves as the enterprise admins and can override all permissions to add/delete/modify the userâ€™s license type. We understand there are situations where users will only need a temporary paid seat to complete specific assignments. For this reason, we will perform quarterly audits to ensure we stay within the contractual license limit. Tech Operations will downgrade inactive users with paid seats to read-only seats. If TTS is still over the paid threshold after the inactive users license type is changed, then we will reach out to [the group managers](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lbf8mkD4eJuKlRg5Uw2r1FHx3YCAiZp7P9qcoEG6rnk/edit?gid=0#gid=0) to obtain a list of users to downgrade. If your team is new to using Airtable and does not yet have a group manager assigned, please reach out to ethan.heppner@gsa.gov to be added to the list.


### Usage Requirements 

Airtable has an Authorization to Operate (ATO) at FIPS 199 Low Impact Level; therefore, sensitive data such as personal identifiable information (PII) and controlled unclassified information (CUI) is not allowed. In addition, TTS is only authorized to give view-only access to partner agencies due the uncertainty of their ATO statuses. Other GSA Components are covered under the GSA ATO but should procure their own licenses. More detailed privacy and security guidance can be found [here](https://airtable.com/appQbn3D4GMM8SD0O/pagaDV7VWDAjLdAC0).
