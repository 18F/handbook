## What is a Slack channel?

When you log into TTS Slack, you are logging into the TTS workspace. Under the workspace are multiple [channels](https://slack.com/help/articles/360017938993-What-is-a-channel), which are how conversations are organized and where communication and collaboration take place. 

A channel is a distinct place for a team to share messages, tools, and files. Each channel has a specific focus. Inside a Slack channel, youâ€™ll find messages and [threads](https://slack.com/help/articles/115000769927-Use-threads-to-organize-discussions-#:~:text=Threads%20help%20you%20create%20organized,direct%20message%20(DM)%20conversation.) that allow for organized and more focused conversations.

Fun fact: TTS has over 1,000 channels in its workspace!

## Is the content in a channel viewable by everyone?

There are two types of channels â€” public and private.

Conversations and content in _public_ channels are searchable and viewable by anyone in TTS Slack. Public channels have a # symbol in front of the channel name. 

Conversations and content in _private_ channels can be accessed by anyone who is in that private channel. The content is only searchable by channel members. Private channels have a ðŸ”’symbol in front of the channel name. **Note: Private channel content and direct messages can still be publicly published in a FOIA request**. 

Slack also includes a function called Connect that creates shared channels between two Slack workplaces: members of both Slacks can be part of the channel. Connect channels have a visual indicator above the message box, telling you that people from another Slack workspace are present.

## How are channels created?
Channels can be created and named in the same ways youâ€™d organize your work: by projects, teams, and offices, among others. 

## As a newbie to Slack, will I create channels?
As you onboard, your supervisor will add you to your teamâ€™s channels. Additionally, the onboarding team will also add you to an onboarding channel dedicated to your onboarding needs and questions. Your buddy and teammates may also add you to channels as well, and you can review the list of [non-project Slack channels](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HAcC0qU756AzeZ38iZOlosN98Xeppr2sJ9LXLOx0UbM/edit) to join. 

Once you become more acquainted with Slack, you may decide to create channels later.

## Can I join other channels of interest?
Yes! You can review the list of [non-project Slack channels](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HAcC0qU756AzeZ38iZOlosN98Xeppr2sJ9LXLOx0UbM/edit) to join.  

Additionally, you may notice that certain channels may have a prefix or suffix listed. Here's what the various prefixes and suffixes mean:

Feel free to join any of these channels even if you are not actively part of the
group and are just interested.

## Do you have any tips on how not to get overwhelmed with all the Slack channels available?
Slack can be overwhelming for both new and existing employees! Remember that you donâ€™t have to be a part of every conversation, and you can join and leave public channels as much as you want. 

Though you may get invited to channels, you donâ€™t have to stay. Of course, check with your supervisor before leaving a channel designed specifically for your team.
