## Custom emoji

Emoji are an important part of our communication within Slack. You are welcome
to add custom emoji. Keep in mind that interactions in Slack are covered by our
[Code of Conduct]({% page "/about-us/code-of-conduct/" %}), including emoji.
Please be thoughtful and mindful about emoji submissions and ensure they're in
line with our values of diversity, equity and inclusion.

Before requesting emoji featuring TTS members' faces, family, pets, etc., please
**request consent** from those featured. Emoji reviewers are required to confirm, so asking/confirming in a public channel can save reviewers a step.

Square images under 128KB with transparent backgrounds work best (though for transparent backgrounds you may want to confirm there's enough contrast in both light and dark mode). Images can be in JPG, PNG, or GIF format.

Per
[GSA Directive](https://www.gsa.gov/cdnstatic/Directives/CC044995_Directive_CIO%2021602B%20CHGE%204,%20GSA%20Electronic%20Messaging%20and%20Related%20Services.pdf), we must review new emoji before adding them. 

### Creating a custom emoji

To start the process to create a custom emoji:

1. **Upload the image to our Slack** in a public channel and copy the direct URL of
   the image. {% slack_channel "transient" %} is a good place for this (as well
   as to test other Slack features). Using a link to the image somewhere else on
   the web often makes it difficult, if not impossible, for our Slack admins. Confirm that any gif is under 128KB. 
2. Open {% slack_channel "emoji-showcase" %} in Slack.
3. Under the name of the channel at the top, there's a dropdown with a folder icon labeled "Workflows." Click on that to drop it down, and select "Request new emoji."
4. Fill out the form, which asks for the "shortcode" name you'd like for the new emoji (in the format :name-here:) and the direct URL of the image within Slack, and click Submit.

{% image "_img/request-new-emoji-form.png" "Request new emoji form" %}

Once approved, your new emoji will be
published to {% slack_channel "emoji-showcase" %}.

### Reviewing custom emoji
If you'd like to help review emoji, reach out to
{% slack_channel "tts-tech-portfolio" %}.

## Frequently used emoji

Emoji can contain a lot of community-specific or media-reference meaning, so please don't hesitate
to ask someone what they meant by an emoji. 

We encourage you to use emoji as accents in your messages and to type the original word, too. For example, instead of saying:
`I saw the :rocket: and it was :amaze:`
say:
`I saw the rocket launch :rocket: and it was amazing :amaze:`

That makes it easier for people to understand what you mean: we do not all necessarily have a shared understanding of an emoji.

Here are some emoji that are commonly used across TTS as shorthand, often added as reactions to messages:
