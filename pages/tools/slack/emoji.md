## Custom emoji

Emoji are an important part of our communication within Slack. You are welcome
to add custom emoji. Keep in mind that interactions in Slack are covered by our
[Code of Conduct]({% page "/about-us/code-of-conduct/" %}), including emoji.
Please be thoughtful and mindful about emoji submissions and ensure they're in
line with our values of diversity, equity and inclusion.

Before requesting emoji featuring TTS members' faces, family, pets, etc., please
**request consent** from those featured. Emoji reviewers are required to check
that consent was obtained.

All emoji must be 128KB or smaller with a caveat: sometimes Slack may reject
gifs even if smaller.

Per
[GSA Directive](https://www.gsa.gov/cdnstatic/Directives/CC044995_Directive_CIO%2021602B%20CHGE%204,%20GSA%20Electronic%20Messaging%20and%20Related%20Services.pdf), new emoji must be reviewed before use. 

### Creating a custom emoji

To get approval for a custom emoji:

1. Upload the image to our Slack in a public channel and copy the direct URL of
   the image. {% slack_channel "transient" %} is a good place for this (as well
   as to test other Slack features). Using a link to the image somewhere else on
   the web will cause extra work for our Slack admins.
2. Open {% slack_channel "emoji-showcase" %} in Slack
3. Click on the Shortcuts button to the left of the message field (blue
   lightning bolt icon), select "Request new emoji"
4. Fill out the form (name and direct URL of the image within Slack) and click
   submit

{% image "_img/request-new-emoji-form.png" "Request new emoji form" %}

Once approved, your new emoji will be
published to {% slack_channel "emoji-showcase" %}.

### Reviewing custom emoji
