## What is Slack?

Slack is a tool and chat messaging application that enables people to collaborate and interact with one another. 

Slack is used at TTS as a means of daily communication and coordination. It allows us to join [channels](https://slack.com/features/channels#slack-channels) — specific workspaces that bring the relevant people and information together —  and directly message people or smaller groups. 

You can also use a call feature within Slack, called “[Huddles](https://slack.com/help/articles/4402059015315-Use-huddles-in-Slack).”

## How do I access Slack?
1. Go to https://gsa-tts.slack.com/ in your browser.
2. Click the green button that says "Sign in with @gsa.gov email"
3. If you're not logged in to Google, you'll be asked to enter in your google username. Enter in your @gsa.gov email.
4. Enter in your ENT credentials into the SecureAuth Login Screens
5. You'll be directed to the {% slack_channel "welcome-to-tts" "Welcome-to-TTS" %} Slack channel.

Mac users can download the [desktop version](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/slack/id803453959?mt=12). There is a [mobile app](https://slack.com/blog/productivity/simpler-more-organized-slack-mobile-app) available through the Apple or Google store that you can download to your work iPhone or Android.

## Do all TTS employees have access to Slack?
Yes! All new hires are given full Slack access.

## Do all TTS teams use Slack the exact same way?

No, and that’s okay! Each team develops norms and culture around how they use Slack. For example, teams may use the Huddle call feature for their daily standups; others may decide to use Slack as a text-only form of communication. Talk to your supervisor and onboarding buddy about your team’s Slack norms.

Slack is also used for “water cooler” chat and social discussions; you can review the list of [non-project Slack channels](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HAcC0qU756AzeZ38iZOlosN98Xeppr2sJ9LXLOx0UbM/edit). 

## How do I set up my profile?

Once you are logged into Slack, please [complete your Slack profile](https://slack.com/help/articles/204092246-Edit-your-profile). This allows you to share who you are, what team you belong to, your pronouns, and your contact information. 

1. **Full Name**: Your first and last name. _Automatic_. This will auto-populate from GSA’s Google account for you. To change your Google Name, follow these [instructions in Slack](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/archives/C028WFKN1/p1674575765831589?thread_ts=1674077147.004539&cid=C028WFKN1). Ex. Technolo G. Tiger

2. **Display Name**: The name that will display when your teammates mention you in Slack. _Required_. You can [edit your Display Name](https://slack.com/help/articles/216360827-Change-your-display-name#set-your-display-name) at any time. Ex. @Tee Tiger, Team Awesome, he/him/his

3. **Title**: Your work title. _Recommended_. Ex. Executive Designer of TTS Awesomeness

4. **Pronouns**: How you should be referred to in the third person. _Recommended_. Ex. she/her/hers. Sharing your own pronouns is a way to make sure everyone feels included and acknowledges gender diversity across TTS. Your pronouns are optional but strongly encouraged. They're not required because we want to ensure people who might change their pronouns don’t feel pressure to have an answer at all times.

5. **Name Pronunciatio**n: How your name is pronounced, in the form of phonetic spellings or an audio recording. _Recommended_. Ex. Teck-Nah-Low-Gee | Ty-Gur 

6. **Time Zone**: Slack displays your local time in your profile. _Automatic_.

7. **Upload Photo**: Your [profile photo](https://slack.com/help/articles/115005506003-Upload-a-profile-photo) that helps your team know who you are in Slack. _Recommended_.
      
8. **Email address**: Your GSA email address. _Automatic_. This will auto-populate from GSA Gmail.

9. **Phone number**: Your GSA phone number. _Optional_.

10. **Location**: Your physical location/state. _Optional_. Ex. Minnesota

11. **Personal ReadMe** - You can link to a [personal README](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1U5Eq3AD7XIP72I0GKr-mMm017s485KLyRfEaSB5yL5A/edit), which is a way to tell your coworkers how they can best communicate with you, work with you, give you feedback, and support you. _Optional_. Ex. [TTS ReadME index](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U5Eq3AD7XIP72I0GKr-mMm017s485KLyRfEaSB5yL5A/edit)

After you have edited your profile, save it and then review it. If anything changes, you can go back and edit it again. 


## Usage

Slack is used by all TTS staff. Some things you'll want to remember, especially
if you're new to Slack:

- **Abide by the [TTS Code of Conduct]({% page "/code-of-conduct" %}).** This
  includes use of avatars, emoji, files, and links. If you see anyone violating
  our Code of Conduct, see the reporting section.
- **[Assume everything you share/do in Slack will be made public, and attributed back to you.](../records/)**
- **Do not post any [sensitive
  information]({% page "/sensitive-information/" %}).** See the [list of
  alternatives]({% page "/general-information-and-resources/sensitive-information/#tools" %}).

Feel free to join any of these channels even if you are not actively part of the
group and are just interested.

## @channel and @here

In general, the larger a channel is, the more careful you should be about using
[broadcast notifications](https://slack.com/help/articles/202009646-Notify-a-channel-or-workspace).
Regardless, please use these sparingly. See also:
[groups](../guidelines/#groups).

## Alumni

- **Keep the conversation visible within #alumni and don't DM staff.** For
  direct communication, use methods available to the general public, such as
  email.
- **If you would like documents or materials, you can either use publicly
  available methods to request that we publish them publicly, or you can
  [file a FOIA request](https://www.gsa.gov/reference/freedom-of-information-act-foia)
  for GSA to release them.** Don't request materials that aren't already public
  to be sent to you — even if they were non-sensitive or documents that you
  personally authored while you were here.
- **Don't share job postings.** This is especially true for your own employer,
  but applies to postings generally. We don't want our #alumni channel to be
  providing advantages to any particular company due to someone's access to it.
  You can use email or other publicly accessible methods to share job postings.
