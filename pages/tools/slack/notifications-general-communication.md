## What are some communication best practices for Slack?

###  @Mentions - alerting someone of a message they need to see
If you want to ensure that someone sees a message in a channel when you post it, you need to  “mention” them by typing an @ symbol, followed by their name, which will auto-populate as you type). For example, if you have a question for a specific teammate, you can mention them in a channel they’re in to get their attention. You can also mention them in channels they’re not in, and Slack will give you the option to notify them.

### Direct messages
You can send a [direct message](https://slack.com/help/articles/212281468-Understand-direct-messages) (DM) to a single person or a group of people. Note: **Direct messages can be published via a FOIA request.** 

### Editing messages
You can edit a message that has been sent in Slack for 5 minutes after it is posted. You aren’t able to delete a message: instead, you can edit the text and leave a `.` or a note such as `wrong channel.` After 5 minutes, you cannot edit or delete your message. 

Follow the [Security incidents guidance]({% page "/general-information-and-resources/tech-policies/security-incidents" %}) to request that a Slack message be deleted in the event of a security or personally identifiable information (PII) issue. 

### Slack statuses
You can create a [Slack status](https://slack.com/help/articles/201864558-Set-your-Slack-status-and-availability) that provides information about your availability next to your Display Name. For example, if you are OOO, you can select an emoji that will appear next to your photo, and a message “OOO until Monday 3/1.”

### Threading
We encourage the use of [threads](https://slack.com/help/articles/115000769927-Use-threads-to-organize-discussions-). A thread is a response to a post that is “nested” beneath the original post.

Threading has several advantages: it keeps a conversation grouped together; folks who post in the thread are notified each time a new message is added; and there are no further notifications in the main channel, after the initial post (unless you choose that option).  

Like other systems, you can use bold, italics, bullets, link breaks, etc. to break up content. 

## What are some notification best practices for Slack?

### @here and @channel notifications
There are 2 methods for sending an alert notification to all of the people in a Slack channel: @channel and @here. You can [read more about these 2 types of notifications](https://slack.com/help/articles/202009646-Notify-a-channel-or-workspace). We recommend using these alerts **very** sparingly, and consider only using them in Slack channels for your specific team/projects (and set team guidelines on when to use).

### How do I get alerted that someone has sent me a message in Slack?

You can [set up notification preferences](https://youtu.be/wuyWwzazef8) and decide what messages will trigger notifications for you.

### Why would I need to manage my notifications?
You are able to [pause notifications](https://slack.com/help/articles/214908388-Pause-notifications-with-Do-Not-Disturb) as needed to help you concentrate, and even set a notification schedule for routine times you'd prefer not to be notified.
