If you still have questions about how to Tock, please check out the
[Revised FY23 Tock Guidance](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FG4Gsv-diySrt8fgZxMCRg9mA1SD2RZJRC07ZlDAGAI/edit#)
for more comprehensive details.

### Cloud.gov

- Because cloud.gov staff sometimes bill their time against customers' support packages, the team must Tock their time weekly. Time not billed against a particular customer's support hours should be billed against Line **1858 - Solutions / cloud.gov / Non-billable**. Team members with AWS should bill their AWS hours for each week (e.g. 36 or 44 hours); team members not on AWS should bill 40 hours. You do not need to log time off in Tock.
- More specific Tock instructions for cloud.gov team members can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16wGnM2vD9y5nrD3Jhufjc-G1r1cs3lkX2Ny-opYk9do/edit#heading=h.2uuhlgoi43ro).

### Centers of Excellence

- **COE /Non-Billable Hours (Line #1145):** Time spent working on non-project
  work for COE.

## What is Tock, and why do we use it?

To facilitate our fee-for-service business model, 18F developed a timekeeping
application called [Tock](https://tock.18f.gov/) that's now used by many of the
teams across TTS. You can access Tock by visiting
[tock.18f.gov](https://tock.18f.gov), and we recommend bookmarking it for easy
reference.

Based on our business model, we have to account for time logged to a project.
Every expense — salaries, benefits, GSA overhead, MacBooks, all-hands events,
and so on — is paid for by our billing, which is recorded by each person in
Tock.

We track each and every [project](https://tock.18f.gov/projects/) in Tock. When
you're assigned to a project, make sure to get clear instructions from your
supervisor or project lead on which category to track your time in Tock — we
want to make sure we bill the correct partner!

The weekly time reporting period lasts one week, beginning on Sunday and ending
on Saturday. You must review and submit your timecard each week by the end of
the day (close of business) on Friday. When submitting your timecard, choose the
correct week for your entries from the list on the homepage, adjust your Tock
entry to reflect what you worked that week, and then submit your timesheet.

Failing to submit your timecard on time prevents operations from running
financial reports and creates a lot of work for other people. Please make sure
you Tock before you end your workday on Friday. If Friday is a holiday, then
you’ll be expected to complete your timecard by the first workday following.

Timecards for the current week should be available no later than Monday at 9AM
PST.

## Tock and HR Links

Tock is a different tool than HR Links and is used for a different purpose:

- Tock is an internal TTS tool that tracks our billable hours on projects; we
  often use that data to bill our agency partners.
- HR Links is a GSA-level tool that records how much and what kind of leave
  (sick, annual, family) an employee takes during a given two-week pay period.

It can be confusing because out of office time IS tracked in Tock. But that’s
only so we can understand that you weren’t billing to a project because you were
out of the office. Leave can only be officially requested via HR Links.

Supervisors approve and submit HR Links timesheets every two weeks (during the
week following the end of a pay period), and while out of office time in Tock
should match what’s in the official record of HR Links, any emails you receive
about timesheet errors are related to HR Links, not Tock. Forward those to your
supervisor for assistance.

## Creating Tock projects

Billable Tock projects can only be created by TTS Operations staff and only
after an agreement has been signed. TTS Operations staff will create the project
using the following information provided from the account manager responsible
for the project:

- A title, with the organization and client name as the leading part of the
  title.
- A 2-3 sentence description of the project.
- The name of the lead for the project.

Account managers can request the creation of a project in
{% slack_channel "tock" %}.

## Time tracking and billing

### What activities do I record billable hours for?

You **must** bill for the below activities because these are direct costs. This
means they are directly bringing value to the partner agency you are working
for. We have a legal obligation to bill for them. They include:

- Work that enables project delivery, such as:

  - Any activity that develops skills or knowledge necessary to perform work on
    an assigned project

    - Examples: guild meetings, guild work, working groups and communities,
      project related skill development like reading, studying, online searches,
      or fixing an issue on your project - basically if it applies to your
      project's work you should bill it

  - 1:1 with supervisor/facilitator (both individual and supervisor/facilitator
    should bill to the project)
  - Critique groups
  - When coordinating staffing for projects with a signed IAA, bill to the
    project you're staffing

- Project delivery work, such as:

  - Discipline-specific work for a project, i.e. Engineering, Design, Product,
    or Strategy work
  - Project team meetings (stand-ups, grooming, planning, retro, and anything
    else!)
  - 1:1s with project team members
  - Client meetings
  - Travel to client meetings, as well as time spent arranging travel and
    getting reimbursement
  - Time reading Slack channels about the project
  - Time reading emails about a project
  - Time thinking/brainstorming about project work, even if not in front of your
    computer
  - Time talking about your project at team meetings, or publicly
  - Time writing about your project on the blog
  - Time onboarding to a project, which includes reading documentation and
    learning about the agency
  - Time offboarding from a project. This includes postmortems, writing
    documentation, and organizing your working files so that other people could
    pick it up later and continue your work
  - Business development and IAA work (for continuing projects only)
  - Conferences, training and meetings that are in service of project work

You must not bill for the following activities because these are indirect costs
and are not inherently valuable to any one single partner. As a result, we
distribute the costs for these amongst all our partners via our hourly rate.
Recording these as billable would mean we're billing for them twice.

- [Out of office (Award leave, sick leave,
  PTO)]({% page "/travel-and-leave/leave/#time-tracking" %})
- Conferences, trainings and meetings that are not in service of project work
- OLU trainings that are not in service of project work
- Internal organization meetings (Team Coffees, TTS Town Hall)
- Business development for new projects (on non-live projects). Developing
  continuation work plan is okay to bill)
- Hiring activities, including interviews, resume reviews, stand-ups
- Performance reviews
- New hire onboarding

### Tocking for Out of Office time

You cannot request paid time off in Tock (see the
[Leave]({% page "/travel-and-leave/leave/" %}) page for guidance on requesting
paid time off using HR Links). But you do need to record out of office time as
part of your weekly Tock. Staff should Tock any out of office time (federal
holidays, sick leave, annual leave, family leave, etc) to Tock line #670, Out of
Office. This is so we can understand that you weren’t billing to a project for
those hours because you were out of the office.

If you are going to be out of the office for an extended period of time, head to
the #tock channel in slack before you leave and ask that the team submit your
Tock hours for you during your out of office period. Example:

“I will be out of the office from Monday September 16th through Monday September
23rd: could you enter 40 hours for me to #670 for the 16th-20th time period?”

## 18F billable hour expectations

If you’re an individual contributor or a lead, you’re expected to spend at least
80% of your time on billable project work. That leaves up to 20% of your time to
be spent on non-billable work. So for most people in a given 40-hour week, the
expectation is to bill at least 32 hours to project work. But what about
holidays or leave time? Then you’ll need to spend 80% of the time you’re working
that week on billable work. Here’s what that looks like if you’re out of the
office for a few days:

| Work week | Billable time (minimum hours expected) | Non-billable time (not to exceed) |
| --------- | -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| 5 days    | 32 hours (80% of 40 hours)             | 8 hours                           |
| 4 days    | 25.5 hours (80% of 32 hours)           | 6.5 hours                         |
| 3 days    | 19 hours (80% of 24 hours)             | 5 hours                           |
| 2 days    | 13 hours (80% of 16 hours)             | 3 hours                           |
| 1 days    | 6.5 hours (80% of 8 hours)             | 1.5 hours                         |

**Caveats:** Directors and supervisors have different billability expectations.
Guilds are given 4 hours of non-billable time weekly to support its leaders. If
your guild is lead by co-leads, it is up to you to decide how you’d like to
split that time between yourselves. If you anticipate any change to your billing
levels for a project, please discuss with your project’s account manager.

There are a few types of non-billable work, used to manage the running of the
organization: GSA-mandated non-billable work, 18F business development, hiring
and non-billable work.

GSA-mandated non-billable work includes time spent in HR Links, mandatory OLU
trainings, IDPs, SF-182s, annual reviews, troubleshooting GSA-issued hardware
(like PIV readers), and so forth. These are the things we don’t have a choice
but to spend time on.

18F non-billable work includes time spent on hiring, in guilds and working
groups (that are not in service of project work), team coffees, chapter
meetings, approved internal projects, conference attendance, training events,
and anything else that contributes to the running of TTS as an organization.

However, time within those activities spent discussing a billable project may
also be billable. For example, if you're in a 1:1 or guild meeting working
through a difficult project issue, that's billable.

Not sure whether work you’re doing is billable? If it’s not explicitly an
indirect cost, it’s project work.

### Issues hitting your billable hour target

If you find you don’t have enough work to hit the minimum billable hour target
expected of you, first double-check that you're billing for all the activities
listed above. Make sure to also check with your project lead that there aren’t
other tasks you can take on.

If you still find that you don't have enough work to bill to the hour
expectation laid out above, **we want to know about it!** Help us get to the
bottom of this with you (and prevent this from happening in the future) by
reaching out. For 18F, please reach out to both your supervisor and the Account
Manager on your project, and also copying the 18F Director of Projects outlining
where things are at.

### Working more than the minimum hours

Working more than 32 billable hours is just fine! 32 is the minimum. However, we
can't work more than 40 total hours without being compensated for that time. If
you find yourself needing to work more than 40 hours, here are the steps to
take:

- Before you work those extra hours, talk to your Account Manager and supervisor
  to figure out if and how much over 40 you can work. The Account Manager will
  need to check and then adjust the project's financial accounting.
- Get your supervisor's approval in writing
- Request overtime in #tock. The Tock admin will adjust the Tock setting to
  allow for 40+ hours to be recorded
- Work your week!
- Log total hours in Tock
- Log total hours in HR Links. This is where your comp time will be recorded and
  from where you'll use it for future leave. In HR Links, you'll also need to
  navigate to `Request Absence/OT` and make a `Comp time earned` request for the
  extra hours you worked.

No matter how many hours you work, it is crucial that you accurately report
those hours in Tock and receive compensation for that time. Knowing the actual
amount of time you work helps us better scope and estimate costs and rates.

Also, please don’t “save” hours or avoid billing for time you’ve actually
worked. In addition to hurting our capacity to improve our project scoping
assumptions, it is illegal not to bill for time actually spent working for
partners. There are several mechanisms and processes in place to make sure
projects don’t go over budget:

- When creating new project budgets, we include enough funds to allow for full
  capacity for each person for the duration of the project.
- We build in a risk reserve to each project to ensure we have extra hours for
  needs that arise during the project.
- Account Managers closely monitor project burns on a weekly basis and
  communicate that to Project Leads and Product Managers.

In short, we need to know if our scoping is accurate. We'd rather be over budget
and have our teams delivering value than be under budget and hiding how many
hours it truly takes to deliver on our engagements.

## FAQ

### Why is my list of “Reporting Periods You Need to Fill Out” really long?

Tock likely doesn't have your start date listed correctly. To fix this:

1. Click on the Users link.
2. Find and click on your name in the list of Tock users. (Your email address
   should be a clickable link.)
3. Enter your Employment Start Date as the day you started at TTS.
4. Click Update.
5. Now that long list of reports to fill out should be gone.

### How do I change a reporting period I already filled out?
