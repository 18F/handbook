Google Meet (which has mostly replaced Google Hangouts) is an online video
conferencing tool that integrates with Google calendar.

We use Google Meet to conference call, video conference, screen share, and
bridge to a telephone line (free domestically).

## Rules

**Abide by [the TTS Code of Conduct]({% page "/code-of-conduct" %}).** If you
see anyone violating our Code of Conduct, see the reporting section.

## Setup

Because Google Meet is a web application, there’s no installation necessary.

You can change your avatar across Google Apps even though Google+ profile
editing is restricted. Here's how:

1.  Open [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com).
2.  Click the circular account icon in the upper right corner.
3.  Click the **Change** link over your avatar.
4.  Update your profile photo.
5.  Click **Set as profile photo**.

## Tips

- You can [add a Meet]({% page "/tools/google-calendar/#tips" %}) to Google
  Calendar invites.
- All Google Meet meetings include telephone dial-in instructions by default. If
  someone is unable to join using their computer, you can have them dial in or
  you can call their phone from the Meet.
- You can start a Google Hangout from Slack by typing `/hangout`.
- You can make and receive free domestic phone calls from within Gmail or Google
  Hangouts. Just create a new number with your GSA account at google.com/voice
- Use the
  [Google Meet Grid View](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-meet-grid-view/ecmogldeoigldjmgieekjifmhaboipmc/related)
  extension to be able to see a large number of participants at once
  - Note this is a GSA-pakaged version of
    [the open source extension](https://github.com/stgeorgesepiscopal/google-meet-grid-view-extension)

### Fix audio issues

If the audio for Hangouts has stopped working, you can either reset your
computer or follow these steps:

1. Click on the Mac search tool (magnifying glass icon) in the far right side of
   the menu at the top of your screen
2. At the top of the search window that pops up, type `terminal` and then hit
   enter
3. In the Terminal window that opens, paste `sudo killall coreaudiod` and then
   hit enter
4. If it asks for your password, type your computer log-in password and then hit
   enter
5. Audio should now work, but if it doesn't, try re-starting your computer

### Presenting a deck in hangouts

If you're doing a virtual presentation it can be a bit tricky, so here are some
tips to both see what you are presenting and who you are presenting to.

1. In your browser, open up your Google Slides presentation (we'll call this
   window A).
2. Click on "present with presenter view" and a new window will pop up for you
   to see a thumbnail of your slides and your notes (window B).
3. Fire up your Meet meeting in a new browser window (window C).
4. Resize the browser window with the active Meet (C) to be half of your screen.
5. Select "present window" and choose the window (A) with your presentation
   slides.
6. Align your presenter view (B) with the meet on half your screen - now you can
   see your notes, the folks you are presenting to, _and_ a thumbnail of your
   presentation all on your monitor!
