GitHub is a closed-source platform for
[open-source](https://github.com/18F/open-source-policy) communities. It allows
us to collaborate on documentation and code, both internally and with a broader
audience. If you're not familiar with how to use GitHub, see the
[introduction]({% page "/intro-to-github/" %}).

{% include "low-system.html" %}

## Setup

GitHub is a web application, and you may be able to do all of your work within
the [github.com](https://github.com) website. Optionally, you may also install
[GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) through [Self
Service]({% page "/getting-started/classes/gsa-internal-tools/#self-service" %}).

If you don't have a GitHub account, you must use your work email (rather than
your personal email) to [sign up](https://github.com/join), as this helps us
with [records retention]({% page "/records-management" %}) and identification.
If you do have a GitHub account, please
[add your work email to your profile](https://github.com/settings/emails) as
your primary email.

### 1. Complete your profile

Include the following:

- Name: Your first or first and last name.
- Company: Your government agency. (If you also use GitHub for personal
  projects, consider specifying "<code>agency</code> (work) + personal projects"
  to make it clear that some of your GitHub projects may be personal in nature.)
- Location: Your primary work location (city, state).
- Photo: A headshot photo, or an image that is unique to you.

### 2. Set up local Git configuration

- [Use your work email](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-your-email-in-git)
  rather than your personal email for work-related commits. This only applies to
  people with more than one email address tied to their GitHub account. Note
  that this is different than
  [setting notifications to go to a specific email address](https://help.github.com/articles/choosing-the-delivery-method-for-your-notifications/).
- If you're using your work computer for personal projects on GitHub and want
  your personal email tied to those commits, you can set your GSA email as part
  of the global `.gitconfig`, then
  [override on a repository level](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Configuration)
  with your personal email, or use a tool like
  [karn](https://github.com/prydonius/karn). If you have both emails in your
  [GitHub settings](https://github.com/settings/emails), they will both be tied
  to your GitHub account anyway.

### 3. Adjust notification settings

Take a look at
[your notification settings](https://github.com/settings/notifications). In
particular, it's suggested that you turn off `Automatically watch repositories`.
You may also want to take a look at
[tips for filtering GitHub notifications in email](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/configuring-notifications#filtering-email-notifications).

### 4. Join a GSA/TTS organization

Have a current team member request an inviation to the
[GSA or TTS Organization](#organizations) you need in the #github-admins
channel.

An admin will add you, after which you'll need to accept their invitation from
the email or by going to the
https://github.com/orgs/<organization-name>/invitation?via_email=1 page.

### 5. Make your membership public

Go to the [18F people page](https://github.com/orgs/18F/people). Click where it
says **private** next to your name. Change that to **public**.

### 6. Authorize CircleCI

We use CircleCI for many of our applications to build and test our code in
GitHub. In order for your pull requests to trigger the CircleCI release checks,
you'll need to authorize CircleCI to access your GitHub profile.

On the [CircleCI website](https://circleci.com/), **log in** with your **GitHub
profile** and you'll be prompted to grant access to CircleCI. Once you grant
access your pull requests will trigger the release checks properly. If you've
already opened a pull request before authorizing CircleCI, any new commit to
your open pull request will trigger the release check.

## Rules

- **Abide by [the TTS Code of Conduct]({% page "/code-of-conduct" %}).** If you
  see anyone violating our Code of Conduct, see the reporting section.
- [**Do not store sensitive information in
  GitHub**]({% page "/general-information-and-resources/sensitive-information/#protecting-tts-systems" %}).
- **Ask TTS Tech Portfolio before integrating a service with GitHub.** Many
  websites offer the option to "Sign in with GitHub" and may further request
  permission to access your "personal user data." Providing this level of access
  can not only share your public or private email address, but it can also grant
  the ability to access TTS private repositories. For this reason, we ask that
  all organization members refrain from authorizing integrations and request any
  desired integrations through an TTS Tech Portfolio issue.

- **Ask TTS Tech Portfolio before creating private repositories.** We pay GitHub
  for the ability to create private repositories and need to bill clients for
  repositories created on their behalf. Before you do anything, drop into
  {% slack_channel "admins-github" %} and explain what you'd like to do and why.
  Be sure to include a link in your repo README to a document that explains why
  it is private. (See the **Exceptions** section of the
  [18F Open Source policy](https://18f.gsa.gov/open-source-policy/).)

- **You do not need approval to create public repositories.**

- **Ask TTS Tech Portfolio before deleting repositories.** As a government team,
  we can’t delete repositories without TTS Tech Portfolio first reviewing them
  for information that they may need to retain (including issues, pull request
  comments, commit history, and other information). [Archiving](#archiving) is
  preferred in most cases. If you want to delete a repository, go to
  {% slack_channel "admins-github" %} and explain what you'd like to do and why,
  and wait for approval before deleting it. This approval is generally
  contingent on no substantive content having been created within the repository
  (e.g. new issues, commits, substantive comments). In cases where the content
  of a repository is no different than that of another repository, it may be
  considered for deletion.

### Handoff to partner agencies

By the time engagements end, **repositories developed for another agency should
be
[transferred](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/transferring-a-repository#transferring-a-repository-owned-by-your-organization)**.
After transferring the repository to the client's organization, create a fork of
it in [one of our organizations](#organizations). This is so that:

- We have a record of the repository and the work done for that partner.
- We have a copy of the code, should they decide to delete the transferred
  repository, make it private, etc.

If the repository is no longer in use, it should be [archived](#archiving).

### Working with outside collaborators

Giving contractors and federal partners access to your repository is both
allowed and _encouraged_ to facilitate the flow of ideas and build a stronger,
more decentralized community.

Confusingly, no one should be an "outside collaborator" in GitHub parlance.
Instead, we should manage repo access exclusively via teams.

Here's our current process to address both operational and security concerns:

1. If the user is a member of the federal government, confirm we have an active
   [inter-agency agreement (IAA)](https://pages.18f.gov/iaa-forms/primer.html)
   or other legal document authorizing the work.
1. If the user is a contractor, confirm we have an active and valid contract
   with them, or their company.
1. Ask the collaborator(s) to go through [the first three setup steps](#setup).
   - They will need to confirm they've done this before you continue.
   - They will also need to add an email address to the GitHub profile so we can
     contact them later when doing clean-up in our org.
   - Do not ask the admins to add the collaborator to the 18F or OPP teams as
     detailed in step 4.
1. (Ask #admins-github to)
   [create a team](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-teams/) whose
   access we can turn off/on with one button. Separate a staff-only team from a
   contractor/mixed/collaborator team for a project, and name it something like
   `Project name - Collaborators | Skillset`. You only need to set a
   `parent team` for your new team if you need your team to inherit existing
   permissions from an existing team (for example, if this team should
   automatically have access to a base set of repos). If your new team is for
   external collaborators, you will generally not want to add a parent team.
1. In the "Description" of the team, put something reasonable plus a
   point-of-contact email address for the collaborators.
   - Ideally this is the address of someone senior — someone you can email if
     issues come up and who can rally the troops.
1. (Ask #admins-github to)
   [add the members to the team](https://help.github.com/articles/maintaining-teams/).
1. Give the team read/write permissions on the relevant repositories. Admin
   rights should be limited exclusively to TTS staff.

When the engagement is over, you must let {% slack_channel "admins-github" %}
know so the team can be deleted and access removed.

### Pull requests

TTS defaults to using branches, though teams are welcome to decide they prefer
using forks instead. Regardless of whether you branch or fork, changes happen
via [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).

In the process of receiving feedback in a pull request, some individuals on some
teams may choose to amend, reorder, or squash commits. This type of "re-writing
history" is compliant with the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) when it occurs
on a pull request because git branches are considered a work in progress. These
actions are not allowed on the production branch because that is considered the
canonical source of information.

### Issues

If you want to make a suggestion to an TTS project without making a specific
change to its code, such as if you aren't sure how to fix a problem or want
clarification before fixing something, file an issue on that project via GitHub.
Try searching the list of open issues before you add one; the error you see
might already be on the team's radar.

### Permissions

Teams can give groups of people administrative, write, or read permissions to
TTS repositories. Even if you have write access into a repository, we strongly
encourage the submission of pull requests for improvements or fixes (see "we
prefer branching to forking when we're working together on TTS projects,"
above).

Contractors or external government collaborators should only be added to teams
with permissions to the repositories they're working on. You can create
`<project>-feds` and `<project>-partners` teams, if necessary.

### Archiving

As discussed in the
[18F open source policy](https://github.com/18F/open-source-policy/blob/master/practice.md),
we
[archive repositories](https://help.github.com/articles/archiving-repositories/)
to deprecate them. In short, that means we are no longer maintaining them,
including keeping dependencies up-to-date or actively supporting the effort. A
repository that is no longer active and archived will have a banner at the top
of the page saying "This repository has been archived by the owner. It is now
read-only."

Repositories created as part of an engagement with a partner should be
transferred to the partner agency, forked back to
[one of our organizations](#organizations), and then archived. See the
[handoff to partner agencies](#handoff-to-partner-agencies) section for more
information.

Inactive repositories are automatically archived by the TTS Tech Portfolio with
[ghad](https://github.com/18F/ghad). A repository is considered "inactive" if
there haven't been any new commits or comments on issues or pull requests in a
while; or if the repository description includes the terms "deprecated," "not
supported," or "no longer supported." The
[current default is 90 days](https://github.com/18F/ghad/blob/main/cli.js#L37).
For repositories that are still maintained and used but have infrequent commits
or comments, maintainers can
[add the `MAINTAINED` topic](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/managing-repository-settings/classifying-your-repository-with-topics)
to the repository to exempt it from automatic archiving.

If the repository is published as a package, please also mark it as deprecated.

- NPM: Use
  [`npm deprecate`](https://docs.npmjs.com/deprecating-and-undeprecating-packages-or-package-versions)
- PyPI: Publish with a `Development Status :: 7 - Inactive`
  [classifier](https://pypi.org/classifiers/)
- Ruby gem: Publish with a
  [post-install message](https://guides.rubygems.org/specification-reference/#post_install_message)

#### Unarchiving

No approval is needed to archive/unarchive a repository. Feel free to do so
yourself, or ask {% slack_channel "admins-github" %} for help. Note that
archiving a repository is _not_ the same as deleting it.

Once the repository is active, it will need to be maintained, including all
security tasks.

### Creating a new GitHub organization

[Create an issue](https://github.com/18F/tts-tech-portfolio/issues/new?template=github-org.md)
and follow the steps.

## Actions

[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) can be used for continuous
integration/deployment on public repositories, but is not currently available
for private repositories in (most of) our GitHub organizations for billing
reasons.

## Tips

- **Document your workflow.** There are many different ways to use GitHub, and
  each different team of people at TTS (likely) uses it differently. That said,
  teams should document their desired git workflow for each project, such as in
  your repository's `contributing.md` file. The 18F-Site team offers a good
  example with
  [their GitHub wiki](https://github.com/18F/18f.gsa.gov/wiki/How-we-Git). In
  TTS' [development guide](https://engineering.18f.gov/), there are
  [code review questions](https://engineering.18f.gov/code-review) that your
  team may want to go over as you think about documentation.

- **Do you fork or do you branch?** Git allows you to both "fork" and "branch"
  repositories to make a place to work on changes before you submit them for
  integration into the main code.
  **[Making a fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)** creates a
  copy of the repository in your own GitHub account. **Making a branch** of the
  main repository means you're working in your own little space, but it's still
  part of the main repository---which helps keep the project organized, since
  everyone can easily see what teammates are working on.

## For admins

In GitHub parlance, where repos all have admins, org-wide administrators are
called "owners."

- When you take care of an ask, give it a :check: reaction in Slack. If you have
  questions about an ask, please start a thread so that the channel stays clean.
- Whenever possible, owners should push decisions as to be as close as possible
  to those most affected - like whoever owns or last worked on a repo.
- If you aren't sure about the answer to something, its always better to check
  with someone else instead of guessing.
- If you aren't helping out as an owner, please give up your permissions to help
  minimize our risk.

### Organizations

TTS is heavily involved in the following GitHub organizations:

<sup>1</sup>: TTS staff, contractors, and partners who are offboarding need to
be removed from all government-owned GitHub organizations.

<sup>2</sup>: For the ones that are TTS-managed, get help in
{% slack_channel "admins-github" %}.

We automate some administration of our repositories - see
[`ghad`](https://github.com/18F/ghad) for more info.

### Onboarding

When people join TTS, they get added to [the 18F org](https://github.com/18F),
and possibly others (in list above). Not everyone will end up using GitHub, but
they are granted access by default. The following GitHub teams correspond to the
different business units:

- [18f-staff](https://github.com/orgs/18F/teams/18f-staff/members)
- [COEs](https://github.com/orgs/18F/teams/coes/members) (Centers of Excellence)
- [Outreach](https://github.com/orgs/18F/teams/outreach/members)
- [PIF](https://github.com/orgs/18F/teams/pif/members) (Presidential Innovation
  Fellows)
- [OA](https://github.com/orgs/18F/teams/oa/members) (Office of Acquisition)
- [solutions](https://github.com/orgs/18F/teams/solutions/members) - portfolios
  will handle adding them to the appropriate team(s) within there
- [strategic-partnerships](https://github.com/orgs/18F/teams/strategic-partnerships/members)
- [tts-bizops](https://github.com/orgs/18F/teams/tts-bizops/members)
