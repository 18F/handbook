We use [Federalist](https://federalist.18f.gov) to build websites.

## Documentation

- [Federalist Documentation](https://federalist.18f.gov/documentation/)

## Setup

- Set up your [GitHub]({% page "/github/" %}) account.
- Request access in the {% slack_channel "cg-pages" %} channel. If approved, an
  administrator will send you an invitation to the federalist-users group in
  GitHub.
- Log in at the [Federalist app](https://federalistapp.18f.gov/).

## Rules

- TTS teams can use Federalist for internal or TTS-specific projects without
  cost. However, if the site is part of a project you're doing for another
  agency, it must be included in and paid for by the agreement with that agency.

- For 18F staff only - The Outreach team is responsible for 18F's web presence.
  If you are looking to create an 18F microsite (`xyz.18f.gov`), such as a guide
  or resource, the Outreach team will need to approve it. _Where to start:_ Tell
  us about the site that you want to create by
  [filling out this form](https://goo.gl/forms/gnknCoYSRIF0gGrA3). If you have
  any questions, head over to {% slack_channel "outreach" %} on Slack.

## Communication

- Slack: {% slack_channel "cg-pages" %}
