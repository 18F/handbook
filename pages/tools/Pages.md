We use [Cloud.gov's Pages](https://cloud.gov/pages/) to build websites.

## Documentation

- [Pages documentation](https://cloud.gov/pages/documentation/)

## Getting access

- Instead of putting in a support ticket, users are granted cloud.gov Pages
  access by their organization manager. Head to the
  [Pages access and permission section](https://cloud.gov/pages/documentation/access-permissions/)
  if you want more information.
- To find out who is an org manager for a given site, ask over in
  {% slack_channel "cg-pages" %}, and they'll direct you to your next steps.
- Once you have access, you can begin adding sites by following
  [cloud.gov's instructions for adding new sites in Pages](https://cloud.gov/pages/documentation/#adding-a-new-site).

## Rules

- TTS teams can use Federalist for internal or TTS-specific projects without
  cost. However, if the site is part of a project you're doing for another
  agency, it must be included in and paid for by the agreement with that agency.

- For 18F staff only - The Outreach team is responsible for 18F's web presence.
  If you are looking to create an 18F microsite (`xyz.18f.gov`), such as a guide
  or resource, the Outreach team will need to approve it. _Where to start:_ Tell
  us about the site that you want to create by
  [filling out this form](https://goo.gl/forms/gnknCoYSRIF0gGrA3). If you have
  any questions, head over to {% slack_channel "outreach" %} on Slack.
