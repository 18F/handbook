Google Calendar is an online calendar that provides us with a single point of
reference for scheduling time.

## Setup

Because [Google Calendar]({% page "/google-calendar" %}) is a web application,
there's no installation necessary.

## Usage

TTS uses **shared calendars** for events, interviews, and "out of office" time.
We also use shared calendars for working groups, guilds, and blog planning.

The following calendars are used for internal communication:

- [TTS Classes](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=gsa.gov_gi2e1fc66fh4v5in8ogsm0v8oo%40group.calendar.google.com):
  New hire and skill-bases training sessions.
- [TTS Guilds and Working Groups](https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=gsa.gov_o1aqcv28k1f0nmca5bkch8los4%40group.calendar.google.com):
  Meetings and other events pertaining to working groups and guilds.

**18F also uses these shared calendars:**

- [18F Events](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=gsa.gov_3rapmucstu32ma18da84el20ug%40group.calendar.google.com):
  Team-wide events, start dates, standups, and so on.
- 18F Interviews: New hire interviews.
- [18F Out of office](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=gsa.gov_bth7useo0eeiicjgos2di6ph8k%40group.calendar.google.com):
  In addition to <em>officially</em> requesting time off in [HR
  Links]({% page "/getting-started/classes/gsa-internal-tools/#hr-links" %}),
  please also add an event on the Google calendar "18F Out of Office" and invite
  yourself, so we all know when youâ€™re gone.

**Solutions also uses these shared calendars:**

- [TTS Solutions Events](https://calendar.google.com/calendar?cid=Z3NhLmdvdl92Nm4xaDBlcTc3cHNwMjNzMnVjanFtcjE3c0Bncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t)

You can add the above calendars to your Google calendar by clicking on the link
to launch the HTML view and then clicking on `+Google Calendar` on the bottom
right of the screen.

### Change default event durations

Google Calendar's default event duration is 30 minutes. If you want to change
it:

1. In the Settings menu, click **Settings**.
2. Under **General > Event Settings**, choose 15, 30, 60, 90, or 120 minutes.
3. For even shorter meetings, select **Speedy meetings**. 30 minute meetings
   become 25 minutes; 60 become 50, 90 become 80, and 120 become 110.
4. Click **Save**.

### Change default event permissions

Google Calendar's default event permissions prohibit guests from modifying the
events to which they're invited. Update this if you'd rather send more flexible
invitations.

1. In the Settings menu, click **Settings**.
2. Under **General > Event Settings**, choose **Default guest permissions**.
3. Choose your desired default guest permissions

### Sync Google Calendar with your iPhone

You can sync your schedule to an iOS device with Google Calendar. Use your Gmail
account to sign in.

### Share your calendar outside of GSA

Although you can't share access to all of your calendar events with people outside of GSA, you can share your free / busy times. You may find it useful to share this view with partners or with your personal accounts.

Start by clicking the three dots next to the calendar you would like to share, then click "settings and sharing."

{% image_with_class "_img/tools/calendar-1.png" "border border-base-light" "popup that displays when three dots are clicked next to a specific calendar. Options are display this only, settings and sharings, and available colors" %}

Find "access permissions for events." If you would like to share a calendar link with partners, you will need to check "make available to public" with the "see only free/busy (hide details)" option selected, then copy the shareable link. Open it in a private browser tab or while logged out to view what it looks like for people outside the GSA.

If you would like to add your work calendar to your personal calendar, scroll down to "Share with specific people or groups." Enter your email account and "see only free/busy (hide details)".
