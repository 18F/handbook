A detail is a temporary assignment from one position within the federal
government to another, with the expectation that you will return to your
official position upon completion.

A detail can be a great way to develop and grow your skills while expanding your
professional network. It can also be a way to learn more about a different area
of government without permanently switching jobs. Generally, details are from
30 - 120 days, though some may be extended on a case-by-case basis.

Detail opportunities can be found through formal channels or can be crafted by
leveraging professional relationships. This
[spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cF8SdNhZSBcZXQy566-ZLO5PWK_nVUYmgUGLGzlfq9k/edit#gid=0)
includes the names of employees across TTS who have gone on detail.

Within GSA, the
[GSA Opportunity Network](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tvUDjm9bV42kHF7M7C7ZqA1PnI5qICnI4WBqZOMvDbU/edit)
is where details within various parts of the agency are posted; outside of GSA,
[Open Opportunities](https://openopps.usajobs.gov/) lists small tasks, projects
and details across the federal government.

Details can also be formed through personal interest and networking. The TTS
#alumni Slack channel is an available resource: many alumni have gone on to
other federal agencies.

There is no one way to craft a detail opportunity. However, it may be helpful to
think through the following:

- In what areas do you want to get more on-the-job training?
- In what agencies or parts of government can you receive that training?
- How can your and TTS’s networks be leveraged to connect with individuals at
  that organization?
- Does the receiving organization have a business need? What value will you
  bring to their organization?
- How would a detail with the organization align to your professional growth
  plan?
- How would it benefit TTS/GSA?
- Would the detail be reimbursable (the other agency pays your salary) or
  non-reimbursable?
- Who could backfill your duties while you’re on detail?

## Process

There is paperwork and approvals needed in order to go on detail. There are
Handbook pages for the 3 most common scenarios:

- [Details within
  TTS]({% page "/hiring-staying-or-changing-jobs/assignee-detail/#internal-posting-process" %})
- [Details within GSA]({% page "/gsa-details/" %})
- [Details to/from another
  agency]({% page "/hiring-staying-or-changing-jobs/external-details/#going-on-an-external-detail" %})

GSA also has a policy on
[Details to the Legislative Branch](<https://www.gsa.gov/cdnstatic/HRM_9334.2_Detail_of_Employees_(Posted_Version_-_Signed_on_-_7-8-2016)_%23CC033627_(Revised_3-7-2017).pdf>).
