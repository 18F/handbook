_Please note that this is not official guidance outside of TTS. The following information and process have been used at TTS to obtain Fast Track (A-11 Section 280) PRA clearance under [GSA's Generic Clearance for Improving GSA's Customer Experience (OMB Circular A-11, Section 280 Implementation)](https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAViewICR?ref_nbr=202203-3090-003) for UX/CX research activities. **If you are outside of GSA, please confirm your own agency processes**._

_This information is a product of the Voice of the Public (VoP) program, which supports research operations at TTS. Please contact VoP with any questions or feedback on this information at <tts-research@gsa.gov>._

## Introduction

Many teams at TTS must conduct small-scale UX/CX research to better understand their users' needs and determine how to better serve them. Often, teams must navigate the PRA ([Paperwork Reduction Act](https://pra.digital.gov/)) during this process.

Fortunately, there is a Fast Track (A-11 Section 280) PRA clearance process that is designed for exactly this kind of research (see [OMB Circular A-11 Section 280](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/s280.pdf)). Teams can obtain this kind of clearance under the [Generic Clearance for Improving GSA's Customer Experience](https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAViewICR?ref_nbr=202203-3090-003). However, many still get confused by this process, which delays their research and prevents them from being able to properly serve the public.

The goal of this information is to empower teams at TTS to conduct the research they need to deliver excellent digital government products and services by providing the following information on how to easily and efficiently navigate the Fast Track (A-11 Section 280) process.

## Determining whether you need PRA clearance

### Research activities that DO NOT need PRA clearance

#### You _do not_ need PRA clearance if:

- You are conducting research with federal employees or contractors acting within the scope of their employment. ([Citation](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/omb/assets/inforeg/PRAPrimer_04072010.pdf))
- You are conducting research with 9 or fewer participants over a period of 12 months.  
([Citation](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-5/chapter-III/subchapter-B/part-1320/section-1320.3))
  - This refers to one "instance" of research. For example, if you are conducting interviews, usability testing and a survey during the course of one larger project, each of these activities would each be considered different "instances" of research.
- You are gathering information at a public hearing, meeting or online equivalent.  
([Citation](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/omb/assets/inforeg/PRAPrimer_04072010.pdf))

#### Usability testing _does not_ require PRA clearance.

- Usability testing is defined as "asking users to navigate or perform tasks with a paper or digital form or website while observing them in-person or remotely, and engaging with them by asking semi-structured or open-ended questions." ([Citation](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/PRA-Usability-Testing-Guidance-Memo.pdf))
  - Agency staff or contractors may ask "any number of individuals structured, semi-structured, or open-ended questions in conducting usability testing to improve a paper or digital form, website, or service." ([Citation](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/PRA-Usability-Testing-Guidance-Memo.pdf))
- View more information on usability testing:
  - [Supporting Usability Testing Through Paperwork Reduction Act Flexibilities](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/PRA-Usability-Testing-Guidance-Memo.pdf) (OIRA guidance)
  - [18F Methods card](https://guides.18f.gov/methods/validate/usability-testing/)

#### Additionally, the following research methods _do not_ require PRA clearance:

- **Interviews (unstructured, open-ended)**
  - A wide-spanning set of conversations with participants that does not ask an identically-worded set of questions to every participant and/or asks participants a set of open-ended questions.
  - View the [18F Methods card](https://guides.18f.gov/methods/discover/stakeholder-and-user-interviews/).
  - Example: [USDS blog, see Case Study 1](https://www.usds.gov/news-and-blog/user-research-and-the-paperwork-reduction-act)
- **A/B or multivariate testing**
  - Asks participants to compare the performance of two or more versions of content to see which one appeals more.
  - View the [18F Methods card](https://guides.18f.gov/methods/validate/multivariate-testing/).
- **Card sorting**
  - A categorization exercise in which participants divide concepts into different groups based on their understanding of those concepts.
  - View the [18F Methods card](https://guides.18f.gov/methods/validate/card-sorting/).
- **Open-ended feedback forms**
  - Feedback forms that ask open-ended questions like "How can we improve this website?" or "Please let us know your thoughts".
  - [PRA-friendly templates are available through Touchpoints.](https://touchpoints.digital.gov/)

### Research activities that DO need PRA clearance

#### The following methods _do need_ PRA clearance AND _are eligible_ for the Fast Track (A-11 Section 280) process at GSA:

- **Screener surveys for recruitment**
  - These are forms used to collect information about potential research participants (such as demographic information).
    - Example: [Vote.gov UX research participant signup list](https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAViewIC?ref_nbr=202208-3090-003&icID=257585)
    - _\*\*Please note that collecting Personally Identifiable Information (PII) has privacy implications; please work with GSAIT's Privacy Office (<privacy.office@gsa.gov>) or your supporting counsel in OGC's Tech Law Division to address these implications._
- **Feedback surveys**
  - (Quantitative) This could include, for example, feedback surveys that are based on a Likert scale and/or any other questioning that will produce numerical data for analysis.
  - Example: [IRS Direct File post submission survey](https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAViewIC?ref_nbr=202208-3090-003&icID=264606)
  - (Close-ended, qualitative) This could include surveys that ask a set of identically worded questions with close-ended responses to participants.
    - Example: [USWDS top tasks research study](https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAViewIC?ref_nbr=202203-3090-003&icID=258408)

#### If your research does not fall into one of these categories covered by [GSA’s generic clearance](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/s280.pdf) (customer research or feedback), it will _not be eligible_ for the Fast Track (A-11 Section 280) process.

- Larger-scale research that implies statistical rigor or relates to the development of surveys, program effectiveness metrics, or outcome measures and program-level decision-making will not be covered by A-11 Section 280.
  - Example: [GSA equity study on remote identity proofing](https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAViewICR?ref_nbr=202401-3090-004)
- If you think your research likely requires PRA clearance AND is not eligible for the Fast Track (A-11 Section 280) process, please contact <GSARegSec@gsa.gov> and consult [pra.digital.gov](http://pra.digital.gov) for more information.

### Step-by-step instructions

Follow the steps outlined below to request Fast Track (A-11 Section 280) PRA clearance for your research:

#### 1. Documentation

- Download the [Generic A-11 Information Collection Review (ICR) template](https://community-dc.max.gov/x/RoFMmQ) (PIV card login required) and complete it for your research project.
  - Detailed instructions on how to complete the form are included at the link above.
- Attach all completed instruments (forms, surveys, etc.), instructions and scripts to this document to create the Gen IC package.
  - Google forms is an allowed platform for public participant recruiting screeners and UX/CX research in GSA.
    - It is recommended to send Word documents or screenshots for ease of use in providing feedback to submitted materials, as the OMB CX team cannot access Google links.
  - Apply the [GSA OMB control number found here](https://community-dc.max.gov/display/Performance/List+of+Departments+with+A-11+Umbrella+Clearance+for+CX+Research) (PIV card login required) to all instruments.
    - Use the “GSA Touchpoints” control number if using a Touchpoints form; otherwise use the generic GSA control number. Contact <GSARegSec@gsa.gov> for support if necessary.
- To avoid common mistakes, please consult the OMB CX Team’s [tips on how to finalize the template](https://community-dc.max.gov/display/Performance/GUIDE+TO+NAVIGATING+THE+A-11+UMBRELLA+CLEARANCE+APPROVAL+PROCESS+FOR+CX+RESEARCH#GUIDETONAVIGATINGTHEA11UMBRELLACLEARANCEAPPROVALPROCESSFORCXRESEARCH-HowdoIfinalizemyinformationcollectioninstrument?) (PIV card login required).

#### 2. Pre-review

- If you would like the OMB CX Team to pre-review your Gen IC package (template and all instruments, instructions, and scripts), email it to the OMB CX Team for pre-review.
  - They will suggest edits within the document and make sure the Gen IC package is complete.
  - [View OMB CX Team contact information here](https://community-dc.max.gov/x/8oRMmQ) (PIV card login required).
  - You should also cc the GSA PRA Desk (<GSARegSec@gsa.gov>).
- Make any necessary edits to finalize submission.
  - Double check with the OMB CX Team if necessary.

#### 3. Submission

- Email your finalized Gen IC package to GSA PRA Desk (cc’ing OMB CX Team).
- GSA PRA Desk will upload your Gen IC package into ROCIS.
  - ROCIS is the electronic management system where IC data gets uploaded and filed. You will not have to interface with this system.

#### 4. Review

- OMB CX Team receives Gen IC package in ROCIS and reviews it.
  - OMB CX Team will enter the decision into ROCIS.
  - GSA PRA Desk is automatically notified of approval through ROCIS.
- OMB CX PRA Team will notify you of the decision by email.
  - If denied, you must repeat the process.

#### 5. Using the PRA clearance

- If approved, you may proceed with research!

#### 6. Making changes after receiving PRA clearance

- You do not need to repeat the approval process if you are making de minimus changes.  
([More information](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/PRA-Usability-Testing-Guidance-Memo.pdf)).
  - These are changes that affect only the look and feel (design improvements or minor plain language edits that do not change the nature or type of information collected and do not increase burden on the public). Examples include:
    - Color
    - Visual layout
    - Reordering instructions
    - Correcting grammar or framing questions in plain language
    - Fixing an address or phone number
    - Making a field or option more prominent
    - Updating an icon
- “Non-substantive” changes should be submitted to OMB. ([More information](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/PRA-Usability-Testing-Guidance-Memo.pdf)).
  - Non-substantive changes are those that do not introduce new concepts or have new intended uses for the data being collected that go beyond what was described in the original approval). However, once you submit them, they generally get them approved within days.
- If you need to amend the instrument or number of burden hours, you must repeat the above process to get approval for the changes.
  - If you need to make substantive changes, work with the OMB CX Team and GSA PRA Desk to do so.
