GSA's [Online University (OLU)](https://gsaolu.gsa.gov/) is the home for
mandatory trainings, as well as recommended and optional
training opportunities for GSA employees.

## Online University (OLU) classes

Required classes will be assigned in OLU and pushed individually to the OLU home
page of TTS employees under **My Learning**.

Time spent taking OLU trainings should be coded as
`969 - GSA-mandated Non-Billable Work` in [Tock]({% page "/tock" %}).

### Mandatory training list

The [Mandatory Training InSite page](https://insite.gsa.gov/employee-resources/training-and-development/mandatory-training) provides the full list of required courses for both new and current employees. Supervisor courses are listed in a [separate document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zlJfhQUeBkKpnJkYXVjxb0ip8IUr_TKWIQJ6sBoZrI8/edit#gid=0).
