The GSA [Online University (OLU)](https://gsaolu.gsa.gov/) is the home for
mandatory trainings, as well as a repository of recommended and optional
training opportunities, for GSA employees.

## Online University (OLU) classes

Required classes will be assigned in OLU and pushed individually to the OLU home
page of TTS employees under **My Learning Assignments**.

Time spent taking OLU trainings should be coded as
`969 - GSA-mandated Non-Billable Work` in [Tock]({% page "/tock" %}).

_GSA OLU training material sometimes has trouble with certain browsers. We
recommend using [Citrix]({% page "/virtual-desktop" %}) and Internet Explorer
or, on Mac, Safari, to ensure successful course completion and documentation._
