GSA's [Online University (OLU)](https://gsaolu.gsa.gov/) is the home for
mandatory trainings, as well as recommended and optional
training opportunities for GSA employees.

## Online University (OLU) classes

Required classes will be assigned in OLU and pushed individually to the OLU home
page of TTS employees under **My Learning**.

Time spent taking OLU trainings should be coded as
`969 - GSA-mandated Non-Billable Work` in [Tock]({% page "/tock" %}).

### Mandatory training list

The [Mandatory Training InSite page](https://insite.gsa.gov/employee-resources/training-and-development/mandatory-training) provides the full list of required courses for both new and current employees. Supervisor courses are listed in a [separate document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zlJfhQUeBkKpnJkYXVjxb0ip8IUr_TKWIQJ6sBoZrI8/edit#gid=0).

## Help with OLU

For help with OLU once you've logged in, click on the **Need Help** tile on the OLU homepage.

Contacting OLU support can be helpful for:

- Getting access for new team members
  - It is best to have the person's supervisor send the email, since the supervisor may be required to authorize OLU access for the new team member
- Addressing issues with mandatory trainings not appearing

### Sending an email

After clicking **Need Help** on the homepage:

1. Under the **SELECT SPECIFIC SUPPORT ROOM** heading, select **GSA Online University** from the dropdown for the support room
1. On the next page, click on the **Email Support** button
