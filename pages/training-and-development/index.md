There are many development and training opportunities within GSA that are
available to TTS employees.

Supervisors are responsible for guiding their employees to developmental
opportunities while individuals are responsible for taking the initiative to
support their own development. There are resources
[for supervisors](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HB9Gg2J_zra8SfJsxZ3cxyXvyaRfLhE8jw0q234KyXc/edit?usp=sharing)
and
[for employees](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jVolEwO-Kt0SPOJ5DJSzmhIzMPMUjeL35BTeMgdwj7A/edit?usp=sharing)
that provide tips for how to recognize and seek ongoing growth opportunities.

In the Office of Human Resources Management (OHRM), GSA's Talent Development
Division offers a number of different training, developmental, and coaching
options. Here are training benefits available to all GSA employees.

## Free training and development opportunities

### Online University (OLU) trainings

The [Online University (OLU)](https://gsaolu.gsa.gov/) isn't just for mandatory
trainings. It also offers over 2,000 personal development courses including:
project management, coaching skills, finance, giving feedback, professional
effectiveness and makes available a large selection of online books covering a
wide range of subjects.

TTS also maintains a
[curated list of free courses on OLU](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_IofrlGEDxOt54XWSrw9S0RlJOrlVcZjOJlcqxzMOOI/edit?usp=sharing)
that are open to all TTS employees on a first-come, first-served basis. This
list is updated weekly, and most of these trainings are virtual to make it
accessible to everyone. If you need help or have OLU questions, contact
[GSAOLUSupport@mail.eskillz.com](mailto:GSAOLUSupport@mail.eskillz.com).

### Guilds, Communities of practice, and working groups

TTS has a [collection of
communities]({% page "/training-and-development/working-groups-and-guilds-101/" %})
to help develop best practices, provide training, explore new ideas, and help
solve thorny issues. Most meet regularly and hold discussion related to a
central theme.

### Supervisor training

GSA InSite has compiled a list of
[supervisor trainings](https://insite.gsa.gov/topics/training-and-development/supervisor-resources/new-supervisors)

### Coaching

GSA provides multiple, free coaching services for internal staff. Located
throughout the agency, coaches in the federal coaching network have various
roles and complete coaching work in addition to their main assignments.
