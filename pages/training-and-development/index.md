There are many development and training opportunities within GSA that are
available to TTS employees.

Supervisors are responsible for guiding their employees to developmental
opportunities while individuals are responsible for taking the initiative to
support their own development. There are resources
[for supervisors](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HB9Gg2J_zra8SfJsxZ3cxyXvyaRfLhE8jw0q234KyXc/edit?usp=sharing)
and
[for employees](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jVolEwO-Kt0SPOJ5DJSzmhIzMPMUjeL35BTeMgdwj7A/edit?usp=sharing)
that provide tips for how to recognize and seek ongoing growth opportunities.

In the Office of Human Resources Management (OHRM), GSA's Talent Development
Division offers a number of different training, developmental, and coaching
options. Here are training benefits available to all GSA employees.
