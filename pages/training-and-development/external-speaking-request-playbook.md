**If this is a press request (newspaper, TV station, radio station, podcast, or
blog) forward the request to [press@gsa.gov](mailto:press@gsa.gov) and do not
respond directly. OSC will handle responding, coordinating, and gaining the
necessary approvals.**

## Share your expertise

We want you to share your expertise and represent TTS/GSA, and we want the
approval process to be as seamless, transparent, and speedy as possible. We
understand this process is complex. If you have questions or want additional
information, please reach out to {% slack_channel "trainings-conferences" %} in
Slack or via email at [tts-events@gsa.gov](mailto:tts-events@gsa.gov). We also
have a help
[slide](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1k8DazgKibsgN5e3kyfghGeAEAqDET251-sV71UrkGNk/edit?usp=sharing)
and
[office hours🔒](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/selfsched?sstoken=UUtoczVQMkFlT2FSfGRlZmF1bHR8OTE5Y2UyMDBjYzlhMWY4NjkxNThkMmI5ZGI4ZWMzMmM).

Speaking externally in your official capacity is a privilege, as you are
representing GSA and your fellow TTSers. There is an approval process. GSA’s
Office of Strategic Communications (OSC) and TTS Outreach must approve your
participation, talking points, and presentation materials before you can
participate in any external eventsin an official capacity. For additional
information on representing GSA in an official vs. personal, please see official
vs. personal section.

This playbook contains the most recently updated speaking guidelines. It’s the
best place to start whenever you have the opportunity to speak. If it's your
first engagement or if you haven't been on the speaking circuit for a while,
schedule a run-through with [TTS Outreach](mailto:tts-outreach@gsa.gov) once
your request has been approved. This process has four major steps and can take
up to 3-6 weeks to complete. Here is a breakdown of the four major steps.

  </h3>

<div id="a2" class="usa-accordion__content usa-prose" markdown=1>
If you have been formally invited to participate in a speaking engagement, you need to think through the following questions.

- Will you be speaking in your personal capacity? For additional information on
  representing GSA in a official capacity versus a personal capacity, please see
  [Official vs. personal capacity](#additional-information) in the additional
  information section.
- Do you have time?
- Does the event fit fully within your realm of expertise? Is there someone else
  at TTS that may be a better fit for this speaking opportunity?
- Have you reviewed the
  [Event Justification Example](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13BCETwANCx9JRPgFbRibqRGthIvf4XQ-WTYD0P30PWg/edit#)?
- Does the event reflect TTS and your team’s larger mission?
- Are you clear how speaking on this topic to this audience in this forum
  advances TTS and your team?

**Critical questions** that you need to address before submitting a speaker
event request. If you answer yes to any of the following questions, stop here
and contact your direct supervisor or
[TTS Outreach](mailto:tts-outreach@gsa.gov).

- Are you submitting a proposal for an event or conference?
- Is a colleague better suited to speaking on this topic?
- Are there any sensitivities that may preclude you from speaking publicly?
- Is this event not inclusive or representative of our TTS diversity?
- Is this event scheduled for less than 15 days from now?
- If you answer yes to any of these questions, stop here and contact your direct
supervisor or [TTS Outreach](mailto:tts-outreach@gsa.gov).

      type="button"
    >
    Step 3: Gather information and submit your request
</button>
</h3>

<div id="a3" class="usa-accordion__content usa-prose" markdown=1>

Request that your external event point of contact complete the
[TTS Speaker Request Form](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13rdrk-5F_cM8ZztarEH5Ty2ElUVuRdxINQqWAPiVNb0/edit#heading=h.d6kk6wkyrvzf)
to ensure you have all of the critical information for the approval process and
return to you, ccing [speakers@gsa.gov](mailto:speakers@gsa.gov).

#### Gather information

##### 1. Prepare your talking points

Talking points are required for you to get approval to represent GSA at a
speaking engagement.

- Use the
  [TTS-wide Talking Points Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vsqMqtcZSSq_IhpFhtUnnNH70hcHGVaWnxhSpe_s054/edit)
  to create talking points.
- Have a brief intro prepared for your engagement, along with a few lines about
  your role at GSA. For guidance, see the above Talking Points Template.
- Once you’ve drafted your talking points, submit them to your direct
  supervisor. And if you will be speaking about a specific engagement, submit
  your drafted talking points to the engagement lead.
- Review the
  [TTS Internal/External Virtual Events Guidance](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YrDs9PA8HkfLkhSfOfyJnLjAYcTkV6_vHlU7HBoyi0k/edit)
  and know how to answer Project Specific/TTS/GSA-specific questions, including
  those outside your direct area of expertise or the topic at hand.
- Gather feedback from your peers prior submitting your Talking Points.

##### 2. Submit your request

Complete and submit the
[TTS Events’ Speaking, Conferences, and Training Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeQHPIOtNwzEA7IxrJ4JDHeEUrWNUsiEkbnp8lK26jX04PYBg/viewform)
to TTS Events.

**To fill out this form, you will need:**

- A description of the audience
- A copy of your event invite [create a PDF and upload to Google Drive; make it
  accessible to all of GSA]
- To know if the press is invited
- To know if your event/panel will be pre-recorded
- To explain why your participation is beneficial
- Complete Talking Point

Once you
[submit a request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeQHPIOtNwzEA7IxrJ4JDHeEUrWNUsiEkbnp8lK26jX04PYBg/viewform),
you will receive an automated email confirmation. That email will also ping your
supervisor to approve your request, so it can move up the approval chain. TTS
Events will move your request through the GSA approval process, gaining approval
from:

- TTS (your manager, Outreach Director, and Head of Service/Staff Office (HSSO))
- Federal Acquisition Services (FAS), and
- Office of Strategic Communications (OSC)

#### Approval timeline

Most approvals will take 2–3 weeks to complete. Some approvals can take up to
3-6 weeks to complete depending on the approvals necessary. Requests submitted
with less than a week lead time are not likely to be approved–please check in
with your designated Outreach/Events lead before submitting an approval with
less than a week lead time.

- Until you have been fully approved, the event organizers cannot name you in
  their marketing materials. Let [TTS Outreach](mailto:tts-outreach@gsa.gov)
  know if you run into an issue.
- You should not promote your participation until final approval has been given
  by GSA.

You can track the
[status of your request here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HqsdJ-pHZcg4n8vWwfOo8-sxAFfP1LtWxRVBWEbZnMA/edit#gid=0)
with the request number in the subject line of the automated email or reach out

    Step 4: Prepare for your talk
    </button>
  </h3>
<div id="a4" class="usa-accordion__content usa-prose" markdown=1>
As your speaking engagement is moving through the approval process, take some time to consider the following topics.

- Until you have been fully approved, the event organizers cannot name you in
  their marketing materials. Let TTS know if you run into an issue.
- You should not promote your participation until final approval has been given
  by GSA.
- If your talking points change at any point in the process, you are responsible
  for notifying the TTS Outreach Director.

#### Preparation

- Watch the
  [OSC recording on developing messages](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bjtYRnoIVFUIhDlm7ujjGp_JkkOH_I9p/view).
- If you are using slides, use this
  [TTS slide deck template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1WY_7t6Y5ShNilKCjGaUxrcdn6pYnBgqq_VHB0i8UMec/edit#slide=id.gd889e0d6dc_0_249)

- Is your presentation accessible? Do you verbally describe the images on your
  slides?

  - [How to Make Your Presentations Accessible to All](https://www.w3.org/WAI/teach-advocate/accessible-presentations/)
  - [How to make Accessible PDF from Google](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1KGgwKaBGrx0lAglTV-E_xlERdkf9CZ765gqsx3VMUhg/edit#slide=id.gd9c453428_0_16)

- Is your presentation engaging?

  - Are you simply reading bullets or language from the slide, or are you adding
    information that’s available only by listening to your presentation?
  - Can you ask questions of the audience, either verbally, or through polls?
  - Do you use different formats (images, flow charts, graphics, charts,
    bullets, etc) to keep attention?

- Have you planned for the unexpected? Ensure your computer is fully charged.

  - Determine if you can log in from your phone if an issue arises with your
    computer.
  - Be prepared to dial in as opposed to using computer audio if needed.
  - If you need notes, have a print out or have them pulled up on your phone so
    they’re easily accessible.

- Think about your outfit, certain colors and patterns can create a moire effect
  which can impact people's perception and ability to digest the video. If
  possible, avoid stripes or busy patterns and stick with solid colors.
- Be conscious of lighting. For optimal lighting and video quality, presenters
  want to be lit from the front and not the back, so make sure your light
  (whether artificial or natural) is adjusted accordingly. A single light source
  is ideal.
- GSA’s Logo Policy does not authorize vendors of any kind to use the GSA Star
  Mark logo. The GSA Advantage, GSA Contract, and GSA Schedule logos are the
  only logos approved for use by GSA contractors. When in doubt, ask the
  Outreach team!
- Recording and sharing materials: In general, all material that GSA presents is
in the public domain, and government employees can be photographed or recorded
doing official activities on official time without permission. As long as the
event coordinator is not trying to: retain the rights to the content, put the
recording behind a paywall that is not accessible to the public, or use the
recording for monetary gain, then you can give them permission to record and
post.

      Official vs. personal capacity
      </button>
    </h3>

<div id="b1" class="usa-accordion__content usa-prose" markdown=1>

When receiving an invitation to speak, you need to decide if you want to do the
event in your official or personal capacity:
[The FAS Speaker Guide – Version 1.0](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1axPskD_BkYxBDZPGPM7uAGpAQopRWtDGwYdI4Wp6woM/edit).

#### Official capacity

You’ll participate as a TTS employee and discuss the work you do on behalf of
GSA and our partners. You’ll be using GSA funds to travel to the event or pay
for conference fees. You’ll prepare during your work time and use GSA equipment

#### Personal capacity

You didn’t receive the invitation because of your position at TTS, but because
of your expertise in the subject. You won’t be representing TTS/GSA. You’ll
refrain from discussing any official work you do at TTS/GSA or with our
partners. You’ll use your personal leave or participate after work hours. You’ll
prepare on your own time and use your own equipment.

##### Personal capacity guidelines

- There is a general prohibition on receiving compensation for personal capacity
  speaking on a subject that relates to your official duties. Free/waived
  attendance or registration fee is not compensation.
- You can accept travel and event-related expenses from the sponsor or
  organizer, but would also need to take leave to attend.
- You can use title/position in conjunction with your speaking activities, but
  only if provided as one of a number of other biographical details. Bottom line
  is that it should be clear that you are not representing GSA when speaking in
  your personal capacity.
- You can include your office/team in your bio that is included on the
conference website, but you cannot be listed in the agenda as “Sally Smith,
TTS/GSA.”

Yes, federal employees are allowed to be photographed or recorded (audio/video)
while performing their official duties. Approved attendance or speaking at a
conference is considered an official duty. Release forms are not required for
federal employees who are documented while performing their official duties.

Permission for GSA visual information producers to document GSA presenters at
events not hosted by GSA must be granted by event organizers prior to any still,
video, or audio recording. Find much more information in
[GSA’s visual information policy](https://insite.gsa.gov/directives-library/gsa-visual-information-program-18083-osc).

<div id="b4" class="usa-accordion__content usa-prose" markdown=1>

GSA is responsible for providing neutral and unbiased advice. It is essential
that we remain fair and unbiased in all that we do and say. As such, we avoid
endorsing, or demonstrating favoritism, to any single one of the following:

- Vendors
- Brand-name products
- Service providers
- Industry associations/groups
- Media outlets

Therefore:

- GSA SMEs cannot speak about brand-name products or companies.
- GSA will not provide quotes to event hosts for press outreach or marketing
  materials.
- GSA has to carefully consider if accepting an invitation to an event sponsored
  by a single vendor will be seen as endorsing that vendor.

<div id="b5" class="usa-accordion__content usa-prose" markdown=1>

All material (slides, presentations, handouts, etc.) presented by GSA are public
domain, and GSA will not create special or exclusive content for an event that
is not available to the public through other channels. As such, event hosts
(companies or association/trade groups) may not retain the rights to GSA content
nor may they profit off the sale of that content.

For example, recording a presentation for archival purposes, or for later
viewing, is permissible. Putting that recording behind a paywall, or selling a
DVD on which it is included, is not. GSA will provide consent to be recorded or
photographed only if that recording will not be used for monetary gain by the
event host.

In general, it is okay to pre-plan or post live to social media while you are at
an event. From an official GSA account, tweets or retweets from a group
highlighting a GSA principal’s appearance on a program (TV, radio, podcast,
webinar, etc.) or at an event are fine. Be careful to limit your tweet or
retweet to only sharing facts rather than encouraging people or GSA employees to
attend a conference. For example:

- Don't: @USGSA's Sally Smith is speaking at this event - make sure to sign up
  and go!
- Do: @USGSA's Sally Smith is speaking about GSA priorities @GovMediaAtoZ.

Also, avoid making any personalized statements as they would be considered an
endorsement. For example:

- Don't: This is my favorite fed IT event of the year! @USGSA's Sally Smith
  speech on GSA priorities @GovMediaAtoZ
- Do: The GSA Administrator is speaking tomorrow: @USGSA's Sally Smith speech on
  GSA priorities @GovMediaAtoZ

      Waived conference, travel, and food fees
      </button>
    </h3>

<div id="b7" class="usa-accordion__content usa-prose" markdown=1>

#### Conference fees

Under the speaking and similar engagements exclusion to the gift rules, when an
employee is assigned to participate as a speaker on behalf of the agency, the
employee's acceptance of an offer of free attendance at the event on the day of
the employee's presentation is permissible when provided by the sponsor of the
event. The employee's participation in the event on that day is viewed as a
customary and necessary part of the employee's assignment and does not involve a
gift to the employee or to the agency. See
[5 C.F.R. 2635.203(b)(8)](<https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-5/chapter-XVI/subchapter-B/part-2635/subpart-B/section-2635.203#p-2635.203(b)(8)>).

**The waived registration fee is only for the day you speak.** If you plan on
attending additional days of the conference, GSA needs to pay the difference
between the full and waived registration fees, or determine if the additional
waived amount, if provided as a gift, is acceptable under the widely attended
gathering determination exception to the gift rules.

#### Travel fees

If an offer for non-federal source travel payment is extended to speak at or
attend an event (e.g., full/partial registration, transportation, meals,
lodging), then the
[Event Tracker](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeQHPIOtNwzEA7IxrJ4JDHeEUrWNUsiEkbnp8lK26jX04PYBg/viewform)
request must also include the invite, including documentation of the offer
listing each item the source will provided, including the cost of each item as
well as a statement that all the items are provided in-kind, along with a
completed Request for Acceptance of Payment from Non-Federal Sources Worksheet
(if going on TDY to attend the event).

#### Food fees

You can have lunch or dinner at the event, as long as it complies with one of
the exceptions or exclusions under the Standards of Ethical Conduct or has been
accepted by the agency as a non-federal source travel payment. Under the
exclusions to the Standards of Ethical Conduct, the term gift does not include
anything paid for by the government as well as anything for which market value
is paid by the employee. See
[5 C.F.R. 2635.203(b)(7)](<https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-5/chapter-XVI/subchapter-B/part-2635/subpart-B/section-2635.203#p-2635.203(b)(7)>)
and
[(b)(10)](<https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-5/chapter-XVI/subchapter-B/part-2635/subpart-B/section-2635.203#p-2635.203(b)(10)>).

For local speaking events, under the speaking and similar engagements exclusion
free attendance includes waiver of all or part of the fee for an event or the
provision of food, refreshments, entertainment, instruction or materials
furnished to all attendees as an integral part of the event. It does not include
travel expenses, lodgings, or entertainment collateral to the event. It does not
include meals taken other than in a group setting with all other attendees,
unless the employee is a presenter at the event and is invited to a separate
meal for participating presenters that is hosted by the sponsor of the event.
See
[5 C.F.R. 2635.203(g)](<https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-5/chapter-XVI/subchapter-B/part-2635/subpart-B/section-2635.203#p-2635.203(g)>).

For a travel speaking event, if a non-federal source offers to pay for a meal,
the agency must accept the offered item under the non-federal source travel
payment statute,
[31 U.S.C. 1353](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2012-title31/pdf/USCODE-2012-title31-subtitleII-chap13-subchapIII-sec1353.pdf),
before travel begins. The item must be provided in-kind (no reimbursement or
money provided to the employee) and accepted by the agency as a non-federal
source travel payment.
