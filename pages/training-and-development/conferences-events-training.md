TTS encourages all staff to attend conferences, speak at events, and focus on
professional development and training opportunities. Check out the
[TTS Training Database](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vB1xbe02jCpKYn6BGSyCH2FziIRNkXXi29yAFT5N9Dg/edit#gid=1891423646)
to see what conferences and trainings your colleagues have attended. If you're
looking for guidelines around speaking at events (in either a personal or
professional capacity), see
[here]({% page "/office-of-operations/fas-speaker-guide/" %}).

Any media requests (like news or podcast interviews) are a separate process —
please forward the email or reach out to [press@gsa.gov](mailto:press@gsa.gov)
and CC [your team's Outreach
liaison]({% page "/office-of-operations/outreach/#team" %}).

At TTS, the work of diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility (DEIA) is a
collective effort: every employee makes a difference. DEIA should be a part of
everything we do. When creating, hosting, or participating in an event, we ask
that you consider the [TTS Inclusive Event
Pillars]({% page "/training-and-development/conferences-events-training/tts-inclusive-event-pillars/" %}).

These inclusive event pillars are designed to help TTS:

- Create intentionally inclusive events
- Share our expectation that TTS employees thoughtfully consider what speaking
  engagements they accept

For 18F, you can view the
[18F FY23 Training plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P36Q_RF_78SRLcKcz3O3nuA6Nw-Y6MfRR7NB290M5qI/edit).
The plan includes strategic development priorities for team-wide trainings and
notes on the process for allocating 18F training funds.

## Getting approval for a conference, event, or training

1. Submit
   [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeQHPIOtNwzEA7IxrJ4JDHeEUrWNUsiEkbnp8lK26jX04PYBg/viewform?usp=sf_link)
   to initiate the request process. **_Here is
   [guidance on writing an event justification](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13BCETwANCx9JRPgFbRibqRGthIvf4XQ-WTYD0P30PWg/edit?usp=sharing)._**
   Upon completing it, you and your supervisor will get an automated email,
   which confirms the details you entered and provides all of the actions that
   you will need to complete for the request. Your supervisor may want to
   discuss the request with you before proceeding with further approvals.

1. Once you've connected with your supervisor, continue following all steps
   outlined by the email that you received. If you have any issues or questions
   about your request, please respond to the Events Team (tts-events@gsa.gov) on
   the automated email thread. An Events Team member will follow up with you
   within 2 business days.

1. You will receive an automated email when your request has been fully approved
   and paid for or if additional information is needed to complete your
   registration. You can
   [track the status of your request here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HqsdJ-pHZcg4n8vWwfOo8-sxAFfP1LtWxRVBWEbZnMA/edit#gid=0)
   with the request number in the subject line of the automated email.

_Important note about conference travel:_ If you are traveling to a conference
on behalf of a partner who is paying for the travel and the registration and you
will be billing the partner for your time, an IDP and SF-182 approval is not
needed. Also an SF-182 isn't needed if the conference is NOT deemed a training
activity.

### Attending a virtual event

If the event that you're attending is being hosted virtually, please review the
[TTS Virtual Events guidance](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YrDs9PA8HkfLkhSfOfyJnLjAYcTkV6_vHlU7HBoyi0k/edit#heading=h.d6kk6wkyrvzf)
for important considerations and tips.

**_NOTE: If you are attending a free virtual event and will NOT be speaking, you
do not need to fill out the Event Request Google Form above. Please just discuss
in advance with your Supervisor if you will be attending during work hours._**

## Approval timelines

of approval required. It is best to submit your

## Additional steps that you may need to take

The automated email that you will receive outlines the step(s) below that you
will need to complete for your request.

### Creating an SF-182 (required for most conference, event, and training requests that have a cost)

1. You must generate a Standard Form 182 (SF-182)in
   [Online University (OLU)](https://gsaolu.gsa.gov/), and fill-in the required
   fields with the most relevant responses corresponding to your request type.
   - This
     [OLU Job Aid](https://corporateapps.gsa.gov/files/GSA_JobAid_EndUser_SF182.pdf)
     has instructions on how to Create, Submit, PDF, and Verify an SF-182.
2. Your supervisor’s name should auto-populate. 
   - ***NOTE:*** Not seeing your supervisor's name? You can add an additional supervisor (the SF-182 only needs one approval to be completed) to the approval queue by following this process:
      - Scroll to the bottom of the SF-182 approval status selection
      - Select the **plus icon (+)** to add the additional approver
      - Once added, make sure you select the **SAVE** icon 
      - The additional approver's name should now be on the document
          - Email TTS-Events@gsa.gov if you need assistance
3. After submitting the SF-182 for approval, you will receive an email
   notification when the SF-182 is approved.
4. Once your SF-182 is approved, save a PDF copy by following the 'Create A PDF'
   instructions on page 5 of the
   [OLU Job Aid](https://corporateapps.gsa.gov/files/GSA_JobAid_EndUser_SF182.pdf).
5. Email [tts-events@gsa.gov](mailto:tts-events@gsa.gov) with your SF-182 PDF
   attached.
6. The Training & Events Lead (Keith Wilson) will provide a final review within
   2 business days of receiving the SF-182 and any other required information
   that's applicable.
7. Within 2 business days of the Training & Events Lead's approval, a TTS
   purchase card holder will complete the payment of your registration and the
   TTS travel team will approve your travel in Concur, if applicable.

### Booking travel

You can start making [Travel Arrangements in
Concur]({% page "/travel-and-leave/travel-and-leave-policies/travel-guide-2-book-travel/" %})
(if needed) at any point in the process, even before you've submitted the
[Events request form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeQHPIOtNwzEA7IxrJ4JDHeEUrWNUsiEkbnp8lK26jX04PYBg/viewform?usp=sf_link)
if you would like to get an estimate of travel costs. Most travel reservations
will automatically cancel if not approved.

You are responsible for cancelling all reservations (e.g. flight, hotel, rental
car) if your event is not approved. Always **check the cancellation policy
before booking** because you may be responsible for paying the cancellation
fee(s). You can ask questions in {% slack_channel "travel" %} or during
[travel office hours](https://sites.google.com/a/gsa.gov/tts-office-hours/).

## Remote working guidance

When working from somewhere that isn't your usual duty location, consider [these
tips]({% page "/working-while-traveling" %}) to help coworkers and partners plan
around your trip.

## After the event

Add your notes about the conference or training to the
[TTS Training Database](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vB1xbe02jCpKYn6BGSyCH2FziIRNkXXi29yAFT5N9Dg/edit#gid=1891423646)
for your colleagues to read and learn from!

## Buying books

You can also use your training budget to buy books for self-guided study. You
may want to first check your local library system to see what books, newspapers,
subscriptions, and other resources are available there. Approval for books uses
a similar process as approval for trainings, but many of the forms are not
designed for book purchases and need to be repurposed.

Start with
[the training request form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeQHPIOtNwzEA7IxrJ4JDHeEUrWNUsiEkbnp8lK26jX04PYBg/viewform?usp=sf_link).
That form has annotations for how to use it for book purchases. Briefly, the
book title is used for the name of the event and the current date is used for
all of the date fields. On the second page of the form under the "Anything else"
question, enter the website where the book can be purchased.

When you have submitted that form, you and your supervisor will receive an email
with further instructions. In the case where the book is not being used for
training, the only thing that needs to be done is an email from your supervisor
approving the purchase. If the book is being used for training, then there are
further tasks to be completed with form SF-182 as detailed in that initial
response email.
