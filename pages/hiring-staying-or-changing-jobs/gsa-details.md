_This section is about details to or from another GSA office. If you are looking
for [details within TTS]({% page "/assignee-detail/" %}) or [details to/from
another agency]({% page "/external-details/" %}), please review those respective
Handbook pages._

GSA manages intra-agency details via the GSA Opportunity Network. GSA employees
can view the
[Open Opportunities listings](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tvUDjm9bV42kHF7M7C7ZqA1PnI5qICnI4WBqZOMvDbU/edit)
at any time and can subscribe to receive weekly emails about new and existing
opportunities by going to the
[GSA InSite Email Updates Subscriber Page](https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/USGSAIN/subscriber/topics).

[more information about the GSA Opportunity Network](https://insite.gsa.gov/employee-resources/training-and-development/opportunity-network).

## Applying to a GSA Detail

Interested employees are encouraged to discuss the detail with their supervisor
prior to submitting an application.

Typically, TTS employees go on reimbursable details: this means that the other
office will pay the employee’s salary. The Open Opportunities listing will
indicate whether or not the detail is reimbursable.

Once an employee has been selected for a detail and received approval from their
supervisor, the supervisor should email
[PeopleOps](mailto:TTS-PeopleOps@gsa.gov) and
[Agreements](mailto:tts.agreements@gsa.gov) with the following information:

- Employee Name
- Office Symbol the employee is being detailed to.
- If it is a reimbursable or non-reimbursable detail (i.e. who is paying the
  detailee’s salary)
- The name of the new supervisor
- The Position Description number. If it is a detail without a PD, use “Detail
  to Unclassified Duties” and provide a list of duties that the employee will be
  expected to perform.
- Desired start date and length of the detail (for example: 120 days)

**Please note**: it can take 4-6 weeks to process a detail, if an interagency agreement (IAA) is needed.

## Posting a Detail within GSA

Hiring managers who want to post a detail to the GSA Opportunity Network should first submit a request through the [Internal Hiring form](https://forms.gle/hD2XkzivybBQzNWE6).

Once the hiring manager has gotten approval from the Internal Hiring Committee, the hiring manager completes the
[GSA Opportunity Network form](https://insite.gsa.gov/topics/training-and-development/opportunity-network/post-an-opportunity).

- If the detail opportunity has a Position Description (PD) associated with it,
  then only applicants who are at or above that grade level are eligible to
  apply.
- If the opportunity does not have a PD, the Hiring Manager should create a list
  of duties, and will select “unclassified set of duties” on the Opportunity
  Network form. Employees at any GS level will be able to apply.
- [PeopleOps](mailto:TTS-PeopleOps@gsa.gov) can answer any questions about PDs.

After the Opportunity Network form is submitted, GSA OHRM will review the
information within 3 days. Once approved, the detail opportunity will be posted
immediately. Email [PeopleOps](mailto:TTS-PeopleOps@gsa.gov) so they can share the
announcement with TTS employees.

The hiring manager will receive applications as they are submitted via the
Opportunity Network, and the announcement is posted until the hiring manager
requests its removal.

### Selection

The Project Network reviews all applicants for program criteria, such as
supervisory permission to apply, grade level if the position is posted to
specific grade, and location criteria. They do not screen or interview
applicants: it is the hiring manager’s responsibility to conduct an interview
process.

Once the Hiring Manager chooses a candidate, they will need to work with the
employee’s current supervisor to determine the employee’s availability and start
date.

Once the employee’s current supervisor agrees to the detail and a start date is
selected, the Hiring Manager should email
[PeopleOps](mailto:TTS-PeopleOps@gsa.gov), 
[Finance](mailto:18F-Finance-CS@gsa.gov), and [Agreements](mailto:tts.agreements@gsa.gov) with the following information:

- Employee Name
- Office Symbol the employee is being detailed to.
- If it is a reimbursable or non-reimbursable detail (i.e. who is paying the
  detailee’s salary)
- The name of the new supervisor
- The Position Description number. If it is a detail without a PD, use “Detail
  to Unclassified Duties” and provide a list of duties that the selected
  employee will be expected to perform.
- Desired start date and length of the detail (for example: 120 days)

PeopleOps will ensure that the selectee's home GSA office completes the personnel action.

Details last for 120 days. The detail can be extended for another 120 days (240
days total), provided that:

- The detailee and the detail supervisor agree, as well as the employee’s permanent supervisor.
- The employee was detailed at the same GS level they currently occupy. If it was a temporary promotion to a higher GS level, the detail must end at 120 days.

**Please note**: it can take 4-6 weeks to process a detail, if an interagency agreement (IAA) is needed.
