This guide covers the offboarding policy and process.

## When it's time to leave TTS

These steps apply to all TTS employees: permanent employees, term employees who
are at the end of their term, term employees choosing to resign before their
term ends.  These steps also apply to employees who will remain in federal government and other GSA offices.
**Begin this process at least two weeks before your last day of work.**
Your last day at TTS cannot be a federal holiday.

### 1. Fill out the [TTS Offboarding Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfviwI1hePL1oaw7A5hePEfHIgQJQwuheXaoUNVTky0SSx5zw/viewform)

The [TTS Offboarding Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfviwI1hePL1oaw7A5hePEfHIgQJQwuheXaoUNVTky0SSx5zw/viewform) provides PeopleOps essential information. Once you've submitted the form, you will receive an Offboarding Checklist email from PeopleOps. Your supervisor will be copied on the email.  

Note: once we receive your form, we will assume your departure is
public knowledge. If you would like to tell folks yourself, please handle
those notifications ahead of time.

#### Taking time off prior to your last day at TTS

If you are leaving the federal government, your final day at TTS must be worked
in full, unless you have worked the majority of your final pay period; then you
are eligible to take leave for part of your final day.

If you are taking a new role within the federal government, the above
restrictions do not apply.

### 2. Provide summary reviews for direct reports (Supervisors only)

If you are a supervisor and you are leaving within 120 days of the next review
period, you need to provide to your supervisor a summary review of each of the
employees that report into you. An employee's review needs to come from a
supervisor that they've worked under for 120 days.

- Midyear review: provide a written review
- Annual review: provide ratings based on position descriptions

### 3. Review your benefits

- Review your
  [benefits options](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fuPxdhSY4YCYQvTFhjmjtLpRK8_ophZnFA9hsK8zftA/edit).
- Ensure your home address is correct in
  [Employee Express](https://www.employeeexpress.gov/) and consider switching
  your W2 delivery to Hard Copy.
  - _Note:_ Ensure you keep your login information for Employee Express after
    you leave. Separated employees retain access to Employee Express (EEX) for 3
    years, so long as they retain their login ID and password. Separated
    employees who lose access to EEX cannot regain it. All separated employees
    receive a copy of their W-2 by mail at their home address.
- Review the
  [FERS refund information](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TiFdQ-2pyrmib3Zsh1GDGeWorM7F-cbxk1u-82zX0Aw/edit)
  and [Form SF 3106](https://www.opm.gov/forms/pdf_fill/sf3106.pdf) before your
  last day.
- Check your leave balances.
  - If you received [Award Leave]({% page "/travel-and-leave/leave/#award-leave" %}) from your end-of-year performance review or a Special Act Award, it **will not** be paid out. You must use it before you depart GSA, or you will forfeit it.
  - Your Annual Leave **will** be paid out. If you are staying in the federal government and you are not taking a break in employment, then it will be automatically transferred to your next agency (but it often takes a few pay periods). We recommend printing a copy of your last Leave and Earnings statement before the end of your final day. 
  - Your Sick Leave **will not** be paid out; however, you will not lose it. If your next role is still within the federal government and you are not taking a break in service, it will be automatically transferred to your next agency (but it often takes a few pay periods). If you leave the federal government and later decide to rejoin, your Sick Leave will be reinstated. If you are eligible for the FERS retirement pension, unused Sick Leave will be added to your [monetary calculation upon retirement](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/leave-administration/fact-sheets/sick-leave-general-information/#:~:text=Sick%20Leave%20Used%20in%20the%20Computation%20of%20an%20Annuity).  
- You may be entitled to
  [unemployment insurance](https://oui.doleta.gov/unemploy/unemcomp.asp) if you
  lose your job, as long as it's not due to misconduct. The amount is small.
- If you are retiring, review the following resources:
  - [Entering Retirement FAQ](https://insite.gsa.gov/employee-resources/hr-eeo-pay-and-leave/retirement/entering-retirement/entering-retirement-faqs)
  - [Retirement Specialists](https://insite.gsa.gov/employee-resources/hr-eeo-pay-and-leave/benefits/benefits-and-retirement-specialists)
  - [Retirement Forms](https://insite.gsa.gov/employee-resources/hr-eeo-pay-and-leave/retirement/entering-retirement/retirement-forms?term=retirement)


If you have any questions, please email the GSA HR Benefits Contact found in the
[Benefits & Support Contacts for TTS Employees](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15glvq9UakKUN8XTRTa6gRkhBHm2whhQyAGmf8ibTtBs/edit)
document.

### 4. Download copies of important personal documents

- Download copies of your paystubs from
  [Employee Express](https://www.employeeexpress.gov/).
- Download copies of your SF-50s from [eOPF](https://eopf.opm.gov/gsa/).
  - An SF-50 is a notification of a Personnel Action; it contains your series,
    grade, and other information useful to you or required if applying for
    reinstatement.
  - [eOPF](https://eopf.opm.gov/gsa/) supports an offline "print" function that
    will allow you to output all your files. You will want to allot ~1hr for
    the creation of this file.

### 5. Update your accounts

- Make sure that you aren't the superuser, sole owner, approver, admin, etc. for
  Tock, important calendars, Google Groups, critical documents, or processes.
  - Move Google Drive files to shared folders, when appropriate.
  - [Invision instructions]({% page "/tools/invision/#offboarding" %})
- Move all calendar invites off your calendar. Nothing worse than an orphaned
  meeting!
- Log your final Tock hours.
- Make a list of the approved software that you downloaded or were issued (not
  necessary to note the pre-installed software).
  - Unregister the software that you're able to.
  - Provide the list of remaining registered software to the Offboarding Lead
    during the scheduled offboarding meeting.

### 6. Complete the clearance checklist

Annabel Lombard from ({% slack_channel "people-ops" "the PeopleOps team" %}) will
set time with you to complete the
[GSA Pre-Exit Clearance Checklist](https://www.gsa.gov/forms-library/pre-exit-clearance-checklist), which links to an optional [GSA Exit Survey](https://forms.gle/uhQdPiriwD7pLiQBA).

### 7. Return your equipment

When you leave TTS, you are responsible for returning all TTS-issued equipment.
Failure to do so may lead to your final paycheck being withheld until the
equipment is returned.

## Offboarding process

A member of the People Ops Team will `Duplicate` the `Template` in the
[Off-Boarding Tasks doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rp8n78tFHqyvvHzsYuBo_XE3Jg1LwOuOX-R9TMRnZI8/edit#gid=1916685737)
to make a new checklist once **leavingTTS@gsa.gov** has been notified that a
team member is leaving. If the checklist hasn't been created, please email
[leavingTTS@gsa.gov](mailto:leavingTTS@gsa.gov) or ping #people-ops for help.
More detail for certain tasks is below. Note that, per GSA policy, the
"technical offboardings" (access to any work system) need to happen within 24
hours of the person ending their work at GSA.

### Supervisor

- Work with the employee to transition the employee's workload to other team
  members.
- Ensure they complete their last timesheet in Tock.

### People-Ops Team

- Provide
  [TTS Exit Interview Questionnaire](https://forms.gle/PrHtjvkMy6jiMEtW9) to
  offboarding employee.
  - For offboarding interns, use
    [this survey](https://goo.gl/forms/XOy7QO4zcnz6LyLh1).
- Complete the
  [Pre-Exit Clearance Checklist](https://www.gsa.gov/reference/forms/preexit-clearance-checklist)
  with the employee.

## Saying goodbye

### Sending an email

You are under no obligation to send out a farewell email, but if you do, please
use bcc: for any distribution lists you're sending it to. This allows people to
respond to you directly without creating additional email noise for coworkers.

### Using Slack as an alumni

As you leave, you’re encouraged to join
{% slack_channel "alumni" "the alumni channel" %} on Slack. Once you have left TTS:
- Keep conversations and questions visible within #alumni and don't DM staff. For
  direct communication, use methods available to the general public, such as
  email.
- If you would like documents or materials, you can either use publicly
  available methods to request that we publish them publicly, or you can
  [file a FOIA request](https://www.gsa.gov/reference/freedom-of-information-act-foia)
  for GSA to release them. Don't request materials that aren't already public
  to be sent to you — even if they were non-sensitive or documents that you
  personally authored while you were here.
- Don't share job postings (unless it is for a role at a government agency). Our #alumni channel should not
  provide advantages to any particular company due to someone's access to it. You can use email or other publicly accessible methods to share job postings.


### Writing a post on your personal blog

If you want to write a post on your personal blog about your experiences in
government or why you’re leaving, we recommend that you wait until you are no
longer on staff before you hit “Publish.” This helps to avoid any issues with
Hatch Act compliance and with inadvertently writing or speaking on behalf of GSA
without permission.

## Post-employment restrictions

From GSA's Office of General Counsel (OGC):

> As a government employee, you are subject to restrictions on current duties
> when seeking post-government employment. This section provides a brief
> description of those restrictions, when they begin, when they end, and what
> steps to take.
>
> ### Seeking Employment
>
> An employee is "seeking employment" as defined in Subpart F of 5 C.F.R. part
> 2635, and the recusal requirement applies, if:
>
> - the employee is engaged in actual negotiations for employment;
> - a prospective employer has contacted the employee about possible employment
>   and the employee makes a response other than rejection; or
> - the employee has contacted a prospective employer about possible employment,
>   unless the sole purpose of the contact is to request a job application. (An
>   employee is seeking employment with any person to whom he sends an
>   unsolicited resume, regardless of how many resumes the employee sends to
>   other employers at the same time.)
>
> If a search firm, an online resume distribution service, or other intermediary
> is involved, recusal is not triggered unless the intermediary identifies the
> prospective employer to the employee.
>
> ### First Step
>
> Contact the Deputy Ethics Counselor or other Ethics Law staff. They will
> advise on what actions to take and whether a conflict of interest exists with
> a prospective employer.
>
> #### Recusal
>
> An employee must recuse themselves from a matter when they have a conflict of
> interest. If the recusal requirement applies, it extends to any particular
> matter (virtually any Government matter) that would have a direct and
> predictable effect on the financial interests of the prospective employer.
> However, an employee may work on particular matters of general applicability
> that affect the prospective employer if the employee's only communication with
> the prospective employer is the submission of an unsolicited resume and the
> prospective employer has not responded to indicate an interest in employment
> discussions. Here, work on this category of particular matters is permissible
> until the employee receives an expression of interest from the employer.
>
> #### Notification
>
> When an employee becomes aware of the need to be recused from a particular
> matter, the employee should notify the person responsible for their
> assignments, and may choose to document the recusal in writing. Notification
> permits a supervisor to minimize any disruption of the agency's mission by
> arranging assignments accordingly.
>
> ### When are you no longer seeking employment?
>
> Two months have elapsed since the employee's dispatch of an unsolicited resume
> and the employee has received no expression of interest from the prospective
> employer; or Either the employee or the prospective employer rejects the
> possibility of employment and all discussions of possible employment have
> ended. A response that merely defers discussion until the foreseeable future
> does not constitute rejection.
