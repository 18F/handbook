_This section is about details to or from another agency. If you are looking for
[intra-TTS]({% page "/assignee-detail" %}) or
[intra-GSA]({% page "/gsa-details" %}) details, please review those respective
Handbook pages._

An external detail is when an employee goes to work in another agency on a
temporary basis. The [Open Opportunities program](https://openopps.usajobs.gov/)
is a central place to post and apply for detail opportunities across Federal
agencies. A USAJobs account is required.

## Bringing in an External Detailee

Hiring managers who want to bring in an external detailee should first submit a request through the [Internal hiring request form](https://forms.gle/hD2XkzivybBQzNWE6).

Once the hiring manager has gotten approval from the Internal Hiring Committee, they email [PeopleOps](mailto:TTS-PeopleOps@gsa.gov), 
[Finance](mailto:18F-Finance-CS@gsa.gov) and [Agreements](mailto:tts.agreements@gsa.gov) that they will be posting the detail.

The Agreements Team coordinates interagency agreements (IAAs) that allow an office to bring in personnel from other agencies. The IAA process for external details requires approval from multiple offices within GSA and the sending agency. Please see the timetable below for more information.

The IAA is between agencies, not between staff and the receiving agency.
Employees can refer to
[GSA Order HRM 9334.2 Detail of Employees](https://drive.google.com/a/gsa.gov/file/d/1pCfXxK3vnPZOKaXxlyOC9EozXLRvHw4L/view)
for more information. Most agencies use the standard
[7600A](https://fiscal.treasury.gov/files/forms/fs-form-7600a.pdf) and
[7600B](https://fiscal.treasury.gov/files/forms/fs-form-7600b.pdf) forms, but
some may require a memorandum of understanding (MOU), a memorandum of agreement
(MOA), and/or additional supporting documentation. Regardless of the format, the
same information will need to be captured within the documentation (see
[HRM 9334.2](https://drive.google.com/a/gsa.gov/file/d/1pCfXxK3vnPZOKaXxlyOC9EozXLRvHw4L/view)
for specific detail requirements).

Please note: if a TTS office is paying the detailee’s salary, then they must have a vacant
position number available, and they will not be able to permanently fill the
position while it is occupied by a detailee.

Details typically last for 120 days. The detail can be extended for another 120
days (240 days total), provided that:

- The detailee, the TTS supervisor, and the employee’s permanent supervisor all agree.
- The employee was detailed at the same GS level they currently occupy. If the
  detailee has gone up in GS level, their detail must end at 120 days, due to
  federal policy and bargaining unit (union) contracts around temporary
  promotions.

Details may exceed 240 days if documented in an IAA or MOU's period of
performance.

### Security Verification

All federal employees working at GSA must have a security clearance. For those
employees detailing into TTS from outside of GSA, their security status must be
verified with the GSA Security Office.

It is the responsibility of the TTS supervisor to ensure
this is complete. People Ops provides step-by-step instructions on how to
complete the security process. This process should be completed at the same time
as the detail agreement process. For more information, visit the
[TTS security verification steps form](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xX4ro1bm4TtcJpqoz0TbXlpDhiaxLf4coBFg61GPQ9g/edit).

### Timeline for Requesting Detailees from outside of GSA

_Time frames below are all averages and sometimes the process takes much longer
or shorter, depending on complications and the sending agency’s speed._

_Average time to process detail: 2.5-3 months_

## Going on an External Detail

TTS employees who want to go on detail to another agency must get approval from
their supervisor and Business Unit Director. Once
the detail is approved, the employee should email
[TTS People Ops](mailto:TTS-PeopleOps@gsa.gov) and
[Finance](mailto:18F-Finance-CS@gsa.gov) to notify them of the request.

All details of GSA employees to other Federal agencies or departments should be
reimbursable: this means the other agency will pay the employee’s salary.

Non-reimbursable details to external agencies are done on a case-by-case basis
and must be reviewed by GSA’s Office of General Counsel for compliance with the
[Antideficiency Act](https://www.gao.gov/legal/appropriations-law-decisions/resources).

The Agreements Team coordinates detail interagency agreements (IAAs). The IAA is between agencies, not between staff and the receiving agency.
Employees can refer to

[7600A](https://fiscal.treasury.gov/files/forms/fs-form-7600a.pdf) and
[7600B](https://fiscal.treasury.gov/files/forms/fs-form-7600b.pdf) forms, but

[HRM 9334.2](https://drive.google.com/a/gsa.gov/file/d/1pCfXxK3vnPZOKaXxlyOC9EozXLRvHw4L/view)
for specific detail requirements).

Details last for 120 days. The detail can be extended for another 120 days (240
days total), provided that:

- The detailee, detailee supervisor, TTS supervisor, and Business Unit Director agree.
- The employee was detailed at the same GS level they currently occupy. If the
  detailee has gone up in GS level, their detail must end at 120 days, due to
  federal policy and bargaining unit (union) contracts around temporary
  promotions.
