_This section is about details to or from another agency. If you are looking for
[intra-TTS]({% page "/assignee-detail" %}) or
[intra-GSA]({% page "/gsa-details" %}) details, please review those respective
Handbook pages._

An external detail is when an employee goes to work in another agency on a
temporary basis. The [Open Opportunities program](https://openopps.usajobs.gov/)
is a central place to post and apply for detail opportunities across Federal
agencies. A USAJobs account is required.

## Bringing in an External Detailee

Hiring Managers who want to post an external detail must get approval from their
supervisor, Business Unit Director, and Assistant Commissioner (AC). Once the
detail is approved, they should notify
[TTS People Ops](mailto:TTS-PeopleOps@gsa.gov) and
[Finance](mailto:18F-Finance-CS@gsa.gov) that they will be posting the detail.

Under limited circumstances, TTS may bring on a detailee from another Federal
agency on a non-reimbursable basis, meaning that the home agency will continue
to pay the detailee’s salary. If you intend to enter into a non-reimbursable
detail with another agency or GSA office, you will likely need to consult with
both GSA's and the partner’s Offices of General Counsel (OGC) to verify a
non-reimbursable detail is allowable on a case-by-case basis. Please notify the
[TTS Agreements team](mailto:tts.agreements@gsa.gov) and the
[TTS People Ops team](mailto:TTS-PeopleOps@gsa.gov) as soon as possible if you
intend to enter into a non-reimbursable detail arrangement with another agency.
Additional justification may be required or it may be determined that the
arrangement must be reimbursable.

Reimbursable details are done on a case-by-case basis, typically via Interagency
Agreement (IAA), where the agency sending the detailee will be reimbursed by the
agency receiving the detailee. Please confirm your office has the budget to pay
for a reimbursable detailee with your appropriate budget or finance point of
contact. Detail IAAs are reviewed by GSA OHRM, fiscal OGC, and personnel OGC.
Please notify the [TTS Agreements team](mailto:tts.agreements@gsa.gov) and the
[TTS People Ops team](mailto:TTS-PeopleOps@gsa.gov) as soon as possible if you
intend to enter into a reimbursable detail arrangement with another agency or
office.

If a TTS office plans to pay the detailee’s salary, then they must have a vacant
position number available, and they will not be able to permanently fill the
position while it is occupied by a detailee.

The agreement is between agencies, not between staff and the receiving agency.
Employees can refer to
[GSA Order HRM 9334.2 Detail of Employees](https://drive.google.com/a/gsa.gov/file/d/1pCfXxK3vnPZOKaXxlyOC9EozXLRvHw4L/view)
for more information. Most agencies use the standard
[7600A](https://fiscal.treasury.gov/files/forms/fs-form-7600a.pdf) and
[7600B](https://fiscal.treasury.gov/files/forms/fs-form-7600b.pdf) forms, but
some may require a memorandum of understanding (MOU), a memorandum of agreement
(MOA), and/or additional supporting documentation. Regardless of the format, the
same information will need to be captured within the documentation (see
[HRM 9334.2](https://drive.google.com/a/gsa.gov/file/d/1pCfXxK3vnPZOKaXxlyOC9EozXLRvHw4L/view)
for specific detail requirements).

The Agreements Team coordinates detail IAAs, looping in TTS People Ops and the
Hiring Manager.

Details typically last for 120 days. The detail can be extended for another 120
days (240 days total), provided that:

- The detailee, the TTS supervisor, the Business Unit Director, and the AC
  agree, as well as the employee’s permanent supervisor.
- The employee was detailed at the same GS level they currently occupy. If the
  detailee has gone up in GS level, their detail must end at 120 days, due to
  federal policy and bargaining unit (union) contracts around temporary
  promotions.

Details may exceed 240 days if documented in an IAA or MOU’s period of
performance.

### Security Verification

All Federal employees working at GSA must have a security clearance. For those
employees detailing into TTS from outside of GSA, their security status must be
verified with the GSA Security Office.

It is the responsibility of the TTS employee supervising the detailee to ensure
this is complete. People Ops provides step-by-step instructions on how to
complete the security process. This process should be completed at the same time
as the detail agreement process. For more information, visit the
[TTS security verification steps form](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xX4ro1bm4TtcJpqoz0TbXlpDhiaxLf4coBFg61GPQ9g/edit).

## Going on an External Detail

TTS employees who want to go on detail to another agency must get approval from
their supervisor, Business Unit Director, and Assistant Commissioner (AC). Once
the detail is approved, the employee should email
[TTS People Ops](mailto:TTS-PeopleOps@gsa.gov) and
[Finance](mailto:18F-Finance-CS@gsa.gov) to notify them of the request.

All details of GSA employees to other Federal agencies or departments should be
reimbursable: this means the other agency will pay the employee’s salary.

Non-reimbursable details to external agencies are done on a case-by-case basis
and must be reviewed by GSA’s Office of General Counsel for compliance with the
[Antideficiency Act](https://www.gao.gov/legal/appropriations-law-decisions/resources).

The agreement is between agencies, not between staff and the receiving agency.

for specific detail requirements).

The Agreements Team coordinates detail IAA’s, looping in TTS People Ops and the
employee.

Details last for 120 days. The detail can be extended for another 120 days (240
days total), provided that:

- The detailee, the TTS supervisor, the Business Unit Director, and the AC
  agree, as well as the employee’s permanent supervisor.
- The employee was detailed at the same GS level they currently occupy. If the
  detailee has gone up in GS level, their detail must end at 120 days, due to
