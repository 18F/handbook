Many TTS employees are hired on term appointments for a maximum of four or eight
years. However, term appointments need to be renewed every two years or 3 years
depending on the appointment.

If you don’t know when your term ends, you can find your Not To Exceed (NTE)
date by looking in [HR Links](https://hrlinks.gsa.gov/). Click on
the navigator icon, choose `Navigator`, then `Workforce Administration`, then
`Job Information`, then `Employee Request USF`.

## What's the process?

Term renewals are not automatic. They require a lot of thought and deliberation
&ndash; and a fair bit of bureaucratic process, too.

1. 6-7 months before an employee's term ends, TTS PeopleOps will reach out to
   the Supervisor of the employee and the Director of that office with a list of
   staff whose terms are about to end.

2. Supervisors and Directors will consider the individual's performance,
   organizational priorities, position needs, and other factors to determine
   their recommendation. They will also confirm that the employee would like to
   be renewed. Renewals require mutual consent between the individual and the
   organization to continue.

3. Directors will provide their recommendation to TTS PeopleOps, along with the
   following info:

   - How long will the employee's term be renewed for? (6 months, 1 year, 2
     years, or 3 years)
   - Justification
     - Type of work employee does, how billable they are, are they currently on
       a project, and will they remain billable?
     - If not billable, what work are they doing and why is it necessary?

**_PLEASE NOTE:_** The standard term length breakdown for an 8 year appointment
is 3+3+2.

4. TTS PeopleOps will send the list of renewal requests to the TTS Front Office
   for approval.

5. If the **decision is to extend**, TTS PeopleOps will process a Personnel
   Action Request (PAR) to extend the employee's term. Employment status and
   benefits will remain the same and no additional action is needed from the
   employee or their supervisor.

   - At this point, the extension process is completed by TTS PeopleOps and GSA
     HR.
   - If the **decision is not to extend**, TTS PeopleOps will submit a PAR to
     GSA HR near the end of the employee's term to initiate offboarding. See
     [Leaving TTS]({% page "/leaving-tts/" %}) for more details.

6. Employees should reach out to their supervisor for the status of these
   requests.

   _GSA and internal systems do not process extensions ahead of time, so you
   won't see an updated NTE date in HR Links until after your first term
   concludes._

7. After the end of your first term, TTS PeopleOps checks to make sure that the
   extension has been processed. You should **also** check your HR Links account
   to confirm that your NTE date is accurate.

   - Your new term will begin the day **after** your previous term end date,
     excluding weekends. If your term ended on a weekend, the new term will
     begin the following Monday. So, if your current NTE date is 6/15/21, you
     would be able to view your new NTE date of 6/15/23 starting on 6/16/21.
   - Your updated NTE (Not To Exceed date) will show up in your HR Links account
     the day **after** your current term ends, along with your updated SF50
     under the “Personnel Actions (SF-50s)” tab.

   **If your NTE date was not updated on the first day of your new term, email
   TTS PeopleOps at [tts-peopleops@gsa.gov](mailto:tts-peopleops@gsa.gov)
   immediately.**

## What happens between the decision and the end of term?

- Approved extensions are added to the TTS PeopleOps internal Operations Trello
  board.
- PeopleOps sends extension PARs in batches at the beginning of each month for
  all extensions happening the following month. PARs are submitted and processed
  through HR Links.
- GSA HR reviews and confirms the PAR, checking that all information is accurate
  (employee has another term left, correct extension dates, etc.). HR is not
  "approving" the extension request at this step of the process. The extension
  has already been approved; this is just a matter of processing.
- HR sends the approved PAR to CPC (GSA's Consolidated Processing Center in
  Kansas City, MO) to have it processed.
- CPC processes the PAR. They process all approved personnel actions in GSA
  systems and complete the SF50, which is attached to your personnel record and
  can be viewed in HR Links. They process PARs based on action date, which is
  why you will not see the updates in HR Links or our internal systems until the
  extension date.
