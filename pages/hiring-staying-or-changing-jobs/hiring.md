## TTS Hiring Managers Guide

Hiring managers lead the hiring process for a specific role. They are crucial to
filling workforce needs within TTS and ensuring that diversity, equity, and
inclusion are top of mind throughout the hiring process.

The
[Hiring Manager Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HDZYwc8E5_WepNvj55sqa3gc3W1NkHpd_110mSyD6RQ/edit)

## TTS Hiring Process

The pages below cover the entire spectrum of hiring activities, from role
prioritization through onboarding.

### Identifying a Hiring Need

Hiring managers work with the head of their Business Unit to determine if a
position or vacancy needs to be filled. Review the
[hiring needs section](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HDZYwc8E5_WepNvj55sqa3gc3W1NkHpd_110mSyD6RQ/edit?ts=5fd020ec#bookmark=id.7wigkxq4jm1i)
of the Hiring Manager Guide to learn more.

### Role Prioritization

Once a need has been identified, it enters Talent’s work queue. For an overview
of how hiring actions are prioritized and managed across TTS, read the
[Prioritization Process document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1V-7IyFIlLifgRg89TNKTS5oisOF-QdAZsWYCy7ot7AA/edit).

### Hiring Authorities

Once a need has been identified and the role has been prioritized, TTS uses many
\[hiring authorities]({% page "/hiring-authorities" %}) available within the
federal government.

### Internal Hiring and Details

All \[internal opportunities]({% page "/assignee-detail" %}) within TTS,
including details, must be openly shared and competed. \[Details within
GSA]({% page "/gsa-details" %}) and \[details with other
agencies]({% page "/external-details" %}) require additional considerations.
