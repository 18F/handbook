## Current employees
Join the Slack channel {% slack_channel "tts-jobs" %} to be notified in real-time about TTS job opportunities. This includes roles that are open to the public as well as roles that are only open internally to TTS.

### Weekly newsletter
Talent sends out a weekly TTS-wide email with all open roles. This goes out on Tuesdayâ€™s. And, roles can open up at any time of the week: if you want to know as soon as a position goes live, please join {% slack_channel "tts-jobs" %}.

### Other federal agencies
If you are interested in roles at other federal agencies, join {% slack_channel "wg-govcareer" %}. You are also encouraged to share federal opportunities that you find: there are intriguing roles across the government, and many TTS alumni have stayed within the federal digital family!
