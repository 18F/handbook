## Opportunities with partners

**United States Digital Service (USDS)**

For any TTS staff interested in learning what it’s like to transition from TTS
to USDS or just what it's like to work at USDS in general, a few of the TTS
alums have offered to make themselves available for some informational
discussions. If you’re interested in learning more, simply fill out this
[USDS Informational Meeting Request form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfzbkhF6ahHv8-mu3BOpl6l7qg_kVyHuGUpDMcA-cPW60BfoQ/viewform?usp=sf_link)
and someone from USDS will reach out to get something set up.

Be sure to stay informed of current job postings relevant to technology
transformation in TTS and with other agencies by joining the
{% slack_channel "tts-jobs" %} Slack channel. If you want to be notified about
opportunities with other federal agencies please join the
{% slack_channel "wg-govcareer" %} Slack channel. We encourage TTS staff to post
external federal career opportunities on the {% slack_channel "wg-govcareer" %}
Slack channel to help others be aware of permanent, career opportunities. TTS
staff can post opportunities advertised by our federal partners to help them
attract the engineering, product management, and leadership talent they may
require to further facilitate their technical transformation.
