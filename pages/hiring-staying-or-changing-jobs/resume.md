This page provides an overview with examples of how to write a federal
government resume, which have content and formatting that differ from most
private sector resumes.

## How to write a Federal resume

_Written by [Amanda Costello](https://github.com/amandacostello), 18F content
designer and gummi bear enthusiast, July 10, 2019._

**Writing a US federal resume is hard.** When I started writing mine, all I
wanted was a solid example. What needs to be there, in what order, and what
would it look like with real information. This is that example. (**_Law and
Order chimes_**)

Below are excerpts from my federal resume, along with details and notes about
how it’s written and formatted. I want more awesome folks from all backgrounds
and experiences as colleagues. I don’t want the resume formatting or particulars
to be a mystery; it’s already a very challenging piece of writing.

### General things to keep in mind:

1. This resume’s job is to connect the requirements of the job posting to your
   experience using the **straightest possible line**. I printed out the job
   posting and highlighted every key phrase of the requirements, qualifications,
   and what kind of work this job would do. I then made that into a checklist to
   make sure each one of those things could clearly be mapped to my resume.
2. **Throw out your formatting.** I used CAPS for headers, italics for mission
   statements, and bullet points. Expect that the bulk of your formatting will
   be stripped out. No columns, no fanciness. Just write. Hard.
3. **Speaking of writing: get your words going, and then get more words.** I had
   to submit two writing samples, and that was where I could show off my content
   strategy particulars. Remember the job of the resume content: clear, straight
   lines between the requirements and your experience.

> Explicit disclaimer: This resume format is what I chose to use in applying to
> 18F in the US Federal Government’s General Services Administration. It is not
> the only acceptable format, but is what worked well for me. I currently work
> as a content designer at 18F, but put this together on my own time, using no
> government resources to do so. Using this formatting is not a guarantee of
> consideration. You still gotta do the work.

### And now, the resume!

`Everything about this top material is standardized formatting. Go ahead and put your own info in just like this. `

AMANDA COSTELLO  
123 Lutefisk Street  
You Betcha, MN 55555  
Mobile: 555-555-5555

Email:  
Availability: April 1, 2020  
Job Type: Permanent, Telework Work Schedule: Full-Time

Desired locations:  
United States - MN

#### WORK EXPERIENCE

`Below is an example of one job, and how I talked about it. I recommend listing as complete of a job history as you can for at least the last 7 years, more ideally the last 10 years. Here's a formatting example!`

Workplace name, Unit name if relevant - City, State, Country  
Your job title - MM/YYYY to MM/YYYY - Hours per week: xx

_Mission statement(s) of the workplace, or summary of the company’s work on a
larger scale._

DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES A paragraph-long description of what the work was
overall. Describe your work using a wide scope, leaving the specific details for
later.

SPECIFIC TOPIC (e.g. CONTENT STRATEGY)

- Examples are in a bulleted list, each point describing a project or part of a
  project, or a piece of work that fits the heading, plus matches up with the
  qualifications/reqs.
- I chose to start each bullet with a past tense verb (Collaborated, Wrote,
  Managed, Edited), because that’s how I usually write resumes.
- Some of these bullets reference specific things I wrote, and those were
  included as writing samples with my application.

TECHNICAL SKILLS:

Software you know, tools you use, best practices and methods. This can’t just be
a list, but has to have context in your work overview of how and why they were
used. Also, please throw Microsoft Word on there because I was once rejected
from a job in 2007 because I put “Microsoft Office” and the listing said
“Microsoft Word.” Word matching! Seriously!

SELECTED WORK:

- Another bulleted list, this time of URLs related to work I did.
- They had quick little blurbs underneath about what they were, and what I did.
- Photos won’t come through on this resume, so no screenshots or anything.

`End of formatting example!`

University of Minnesota, College of Education and Human Development -
Minneapolis, MN  
Lead Content Strategist - 07/2012 to Present - Hours per week: 40

_The mission of the College of Education and Human Development is to contribute
to a just and sustainable future through engagement with the local and global
communities to enhance human learning and development at all stages of the life
span. The college is part of the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities, a
land-grant high-level research institution, dedicated to generating and
preserving knowledge through research, sharing that knowledge through teaching
and learning, and apply that knowledge through outreach and public service._

DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES Developed and led college-wide content strategy
combining current and prospective student needs with college goals for
recruitment and retention. Worked as a member of a cross-functional team
including designers, developers, business analysts, marketers, and well as
content strategists across 7 academic departments to promote and deliver
effective processes and consistent content strategy.

CONTENT STRATEGY:

- Collaborated with college academic departments, research centers, student
  support offices, and senior leadership to develop a “bottom up” content
  strategy, prioritizing student needs based on their relationships with
  academic programs. Assessed content through the lens of recruitment and
  retention.
- Wrote “Stakeholder’s Guide To Launch,” a two-page reference for the launch of
  a new college website. By anticipating the top questions stakeholders might
  field, this guide gave talking points surrounding new features, along with
  contacts for further questions.
- Served as strategist, editor, and project manager for regular essay series on
  college diversity and inclusion work, written by academic leadership. This
  generated authentic, meaningful content and helped stakeholders better
  understand the time commitment involved in content production.
- Established user-centered college voice and tone guidelines, using “A, but not
  B” format. This was informed by close work with students in formal and
  informal usability testing, and brand sort activities with college leadership
  and key stakeholders.

USER EXPERIENCE (UX) WRITING:

- Combined findings from user research, new graduate student interviews, faculty
  and researcher focus groups, higher ed industry trends, and analytics to
  consolidate more than 600 areas of academic research expertise into 111
  categories. Categories were deployed across the college for consistent
  organization and increased findability of research work.
- Developed strategy and standards to categorize and sort 127 academic programs
  and 111 areas of research expertise. This was incorporated into two web-based
  tools developed in-house and allowed students to explore college offerings and
  expertise independent of department. Wrote and edited descriptions for each
  area, capped at 25 words to promote ease of reading and top-level
  understanding.
- Planned, edited, and delivered a “Web Writing Best Practices” guide for
  college content strategists. Formatted as a “one-pager” for printing and
  pinning up as a reference, this collected links to and recommendations from
  external tools and guides (Hemingway, 18F, King County Editorial Guide),
  internal editorial recommendations from the university and college, and voice
  and tone particulars. Strategists often felt intimidated and overwhelmed by
  the sheer amount of recommendations connected to good web content; this guide
  promoted four starting points to improve content: addressing the user
  (you/your/yours and we/our/ours), employing structured content, concise
  writing, and using plain language.

USABILITY TESTING AND USER RESEARCH:

- Led and managed annual process of web usability testing, including project
  kick-offs, stakeholder workshops, scenario development, task analysis, lab and
  field-based testing, issues analysis, research and recommendation
  presentations to project team members, key stakeholders and college senior
  leadership.
- Helped subject-matter expert teams and stakeholders understand their users
  through research and usability testing methods, defining problems and crafting
  effective solutions based on both quantitative and qualitative data.

COLLABORATION ON CROSS-FUNCTIONAL TEAMS:

- Contributed to responsive redesign of college website by conducting a content
  audit, editing student-facing content for an overall 75% file reduction, and
  migrating updated content to custom-built CMS. Collaborated with design and
  development teams to create comprehensive style guides, pattern library
  interface copy.
- Convened monthly “coworking days” among all college web professionals,
  bringing us together as a team of peers for a day of training, collaborative
  problem solving, idea sharing, and camaraderie. Set programming, mentored
  colleagues on presentations, and collected feedback to regularly adjust how
  our central content strategy was best supporting the specific work of the
  departments.

ADVOCACY AND OUTREACH:

- Advocated for content strategy best practices to over 30 University
  departments by regularly meeting with peers and presenting to leadership
  stakeholder groups. Promoted clear, consistent, user-centered writing from all
  contributors, even those who don’t identify as “web people,” and facilitated
  collaboration across organizational silos to increase efficiency and support.
- Consulted with faculty and staff in academic departments outside the college
  that frequently contributed to content strategy. Regular guest lecturer and
  student mentor in the Writing Studies program.
- Contributed as one of four subject matter experts to the University of
  Minnesota’s Content Strategy Self-Help Guide, recommending resources and
  structuring process for the centrally-maintained system to help contributors
  at all levels improve content writing and strategic thinking for the web.
- Frequently presented at local Twin Cities-based tech meetups, translating
  content strategy best practices to adjacent fields such as front- and back-end
  development, UX research, accessibility, interactive design, and marketing.

TECHNICAL SKILLS:

Provided strategic content design with skills in copywriting, style guides,
plain language, comprehension/reading levels. Conducted usability evaluations
using card sorting (OptimumSort), tree testing (Treejack), direct observation
user research methods. Worked on a cross-functional team that used Asana,
Trello, Slack, Hemingway, pattern libraries, Google Drive, MS Office Suite
(Word, Excel, Power Point), and semantic HTML.

SELECTED WORK:

- CEHD Academic Programs, www.cehd.umn.edu/programs  
  Developed content and structure for directory/sorting tool
- CEHD Research & Expertise, www.cehd.umn.edu/topics/  
  Created new content structure around college research, including categories

  [z.umn.edu/csmap](https://z.umn.edu/csmap)  
  Subject matter expert for update to university-wide guide
