All opportunities within TTS, including details and reassignments, should be
openly shared and competed within the organization. There is a
[TTS Internal Hiring request process](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11EaJO13KL7-NKMu8HwQsJS7nckPFPj5sbKcTwf9jKHc/edit)
for pursuing any type of internal hiring request (open application process or
not). Please submit a request through the
[TTS Internal Hiring Request form](https://forms.gle/hD2XkzivybBQzNWE6) even if
you’re not completely sure how to best proceed.

Although internal hiring actions are processed quicker than external hiring
actions, internal actions still require need, effort and intentionality.

## What is internal hiring?

Internal hiring is done for two types of hiring processes: reassignment
(transferring from one part of TTS or GSA to another part of TTS) and details.

A reassignment is a lateral transfer to a new TTS office at the same GS level.

A detail is a temporary assignment to a different position or a different
organization/business unit. Details last up to 120 days and can be extended up
to another 120 days (not to exceed 240 days total), provided that:

- The detailee, their temporary supervisor, and the employee’s permanent supervisor all agree.
- The employee is detailed at the same GS level they currently occupy. If the
  detailee has gone up in GS level (called a temporary promotion), their detail
  must end at 120 days, due to federal policy and bargaining unit (union)
  contracts around temporary promotions.

## Internal role approval process

Hiring Managers must receive advanced approval from their Supervisor and
Business Unit Head and also confirm funding availability before proceeding with
a [TTS Internal Hiring Request](https://forms.gle/hD2XkzivybBQzNWE6).

Submissions are reviewed every **Monday morning at 1pm ET** by the Internal
Hiring Review Committee, which includes members of Leadership, Finance, Talent,
and PeopleOps.

## Internal posting process

To post an internal application, the hiring manager will go through the following steps:

1. Job prep
2. Job posting
3. Interviews
4. Selection
5. Supervisor approval
6. Paperwork processing
7. Notification of candidates/Providing feedback

Detailed information for each of these steps can be found in the [Internal Hiring checklist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RyQt20hs8ylFl_MmJwOxqEQeZ8AYquH24MFrLbtuFVw/edit#gid=0).

## Job posting

Once the posting is ready to go live, it will shared in {% slack_channel "tts-jobs" %} on Slack. It will also be included in the weekly job announcements email that is sent out to TTS (usually on Tuesday's).

## Interviews

All candidates receive a copy of the interview questions prior to their interview. Sharing questions in
advance helps to create a better and more informed interview experience. This is one way we build a fair, equitable, and transparent
hiring process.
