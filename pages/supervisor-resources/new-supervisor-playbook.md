title: New Supervisor Playbook
---

A guide for transitioning from being an individual contributor to a supervisor,
and/or joining TTS as a new supervisor.

## Congratulations!

Whether you are starting your supervisory career for the first time or joining
TTS as a new hire, it can be daunting to step into a supervisory role and feel
successful at the start. I have written this playbook to document my experience
re-joining TTS as an Engineering Supervisor after serving as a people manager
and business unit director in previous jobs. My hope is that it will help others
who choose to follow a similar path and enable them to feel at home and find
their own paths to success.

If this is your first time as a supervisor, please remember that **becoming a
supervisor is a career change**. This can be incredibly jarring, especially as
it requires learning a new set of skills and understanding that you are trading
control and expertise for influence and increased responsibility. This is okay!
Just be sure you step into this with eyes wide open and be patient with
yourself. You will make mistakes, but as long as you take ownership of them and
learn from them, you will find a rhythm that works for you and your team.

One of the key things to bear in mind about being a supervisor, regardless if
you’re new to the role or have some years under your belt, is that **it is a
burden of responsibility, not a blessing of power**. You must maintain a healthy
respect for the role and the responsibility bestowed upon you. You are directly
responsible for other individuals and that means their success and failure is
tied to your ability and willingness to support them, provide them with what
they need, and hold them accountable for their work.

You are also responsible for making sure your team is delivering the results and
value expected of them; but, that does not mean bearing down on your team
members and directing all of your focus on them. Instead, **you should be
creating opportunities for them to grow and take ownership of their work** while
holding them accountable for the delivery and results. In other words, **a
supervisor should be a force multiplier** that helps expand their team’s
capabilities, thus expanding the capabilities of their organization, and doing
so in sustainable ways.

As a supervisor, there are several core principles to take to heart:

- Inspire your team members
- Coach and mentor your team members (and encourage them to do the same with
  each other as well!)
- Provide constructive feedback that is timely, specific, and actionable; this
  includes praise for a job well done and highlighting areas for improvement
  when outcomes didn’t meet expectations
- Promote, advocate, and champion others, especially those from under-served and
  under-privileged groups
- Give credit and take blame: the team’s success belongs to them, but their
  failures belong to you

Above all, **make time for your team members**: actively listen to people and
hear what they say to truly understand them, support them as best you can, and
promote inclusion throughout the team. Deal with problems directly and never
ignore them. Lastly, be sure to follow through and honor your commitments. By
holding yourself accountable in this regard (or better yet, asking your
supervisor for help as an accountability partner!), you will become - or
continue to be - a successful and effective supervisor that others will admire,
respect, and trust.

I wish you the best of luck on your supervisory and leadership journey!
