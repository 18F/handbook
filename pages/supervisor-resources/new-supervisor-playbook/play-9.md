title: Play 9 - Be patient with yourself and allow feelings of discomfort
keywords: supervisor playbook, leadership

You have just stepped into something entirely new, and whether it’s still within
familiar territory or a completely new environment, you are going to feel out of
sorts, even if you have years of experience operating at a high level! Be
patient with yourself, and allow for the fact that you might feel unmoored. If
you feel overwhelmed at times or a lack of confidence, etc., **these feelings
are all normal and okay**.

Allow yourself to work through these feelings as you continue working through
the other plays, which are designed to help get you oriented and grounded. Over
a period of time, the role will begin to feel more normal. When you start
feeling that everything is priority number one and you must begin taking
immediate action on it all, stop and slow down. Take the time to learn,
research, observe, and listen first, especially before making any major moves.

It is also possible that there will be times when you hesitate to start a daring
talk, often known as a courageous conversation. To conduct uncomfortable
conversations with coworkers about issues like systemic racism, social justice,
and privilege at work takes guts. Despite the potential for pain, you must
approach these conversations with bold intentionality and sincerity if you want
to foster a sense of belonging at work and value among your team.

**Engaging in positive self-care activities, along with frequent check-ins with
your supervisor and peers, will go a long way in building your confidence and
helping you feel supported**. Make sure you are eating and sleeping well
(accounting for the fact that if you have one or more small children/babies,
this is incredibly hard - I know, I have been through it!) and getting some
semblance of exercise (nothing elaborate, even just some walks here and there).
**You may also consider carving out some time for meditation and/or positive
thought reflection to give yourself some quiet moments**. This activity can
greatly help you in regaining focus and clarity, especially when you are feeling
overwhelmed.

**Ask for help**! If you are unsure about anything or just don’t feel something
is right, speak with your supervisor about it. Do not let it fester or feel you
have to solve something alone. This helps build strong relationships and
demonstrates vulnerability with accountability (you’re taking control/ownership
of the situation), which is a positive leadership attribute to exhibit and
develop.

Lastly, **start to think about what “success” looks like for you in a
supervisory role and how you would like to achieve it**. You can use the
[TTS Leadership Competencies](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12MecmFC4rwJZbA_B6qDyU3l7FevR8HzMfuUqRoWKMl8/edit#heading=h.jvdls9ebhggp)
as a guide. Find some ways to measure that success and then have a conversation
with your supervisor to solidify ideas, adjusting accordingly if need be
(especially for ways to tie it to your performance plan). Once you establish
this notion of success for yourself, come up with ways to highlight your
successes and make them visible, and track them somewhere (perhaps a document or
spreadsheet just for yourself). This will provide you with a tangible way of
tracking your progress and reinforcing your successes, and also makes it easy to
share with your supervisor.

## Action Items

- Find a mentor and/or coach not in your supervisory chain who can help you
  think about who you are and want to show up in your work.
  [GSA has a coaching program](https://insite.gsa.gov/topics/training-and-development/developmental-services/coaching-services)
  filled with excellent executive coaches.
- Connect with other supervisors going through a similar onboarding as yourself
  and form a group to support one another and share learnings. In TTS, you can
  request a topic-focused
  [Supervisor Circle](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14ztT9Zf0LV9sIDuzGFc25W_DAxTgq_ZFJQd7LZ2Fhgg/edit#heading=h.mt215ovi8hig).

## Play 9 Reflection Questions

- What are some healthy coping strategies you have implemented since you have
  transitioned into your Supervisory role?
- In what ways have you sought support from others (outside of the support
  options listed above)?

## Play 9 Case Studies

- You are now in charge of leading the team you used to work on. Unfortunately,
  you are encountering a lot of pushback from colleagues who also applied for
  the job. How do you face gossip from others?
- You block out short periods on your work calendar weekly for times of
  meditation and mental reflection. You’d like to see if other supervisors also
  block out time on their calendars for these activities, but you are unsure of
  whether or not to ask. How do you proceed?
