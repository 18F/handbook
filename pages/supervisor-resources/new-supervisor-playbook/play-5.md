To help yourself get situated, **take judicious notes on everything**. Type
notes in a Google Doc, or grab a pen/pencil and paper even, if that’s easier for
you! Document as much as possible, then spend some time reviewing your notes to
organize and synthesize them, especially if you initially hand-wrote them.
Please remember: there are government record-keeping and FOIA policies.

For example, if you are taking notes during a meeting and capture quotes ,
thoughts, and ideas as they are shared, spend some time afterward organizing
things into broader themes. Write out complete thoughts in response to the
information (this will help you strategize how to approach work!), tease out
specific action items (especially ones you are responsible for), and call out
items that you need to follow up on for more context.

Additionally, **create an organization system that will work for you.** It’s
okay if you create a unique system for yourself or leverage an existing system
from elsewhere; the important thing is that you’re organized. As a supervisor,
the increasing demands on your attention make organizational skills more
necessary than ever - you’ll need to follow up on things at a moment’s notice!

The earlier and more often you organize your thoughts and notes, the easier
things will become, especially when you take full ownership of projects and
supervise people. You will have already compiled a solid collection of resources
for yourself that will help you respond to inquiries quickly, and you’ll also be
able to share out with others.

As a supervisor, **documentation on team members is especially important**. Note
anything you learn about the team members you will be responsible for as well as
your own observations. This will greatly help come performance review time or
handling any situations that may require personnel actions.

When creating documentation, be mindful of
[Inclusive Language principles](https://content-guide.18f.gov/our-style/inclusive-language)
as well as
[phrases flagged by Inclusion Bot](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iQT7Gy0iQa7sopBP0vB3CZ56GhyYrDNUzLdoWOowSHs/edit).
Be specific about what is happening, refraining from vague personal opinions.
For example: if someone is struggling to complete a task, avoid phrases such as
“I don’t think this person is a good fit for the team.” Instead, write ‘They
took 2 weeks longer than we agreed on to merge the pull request.” This leaves
you concrete details to refer back to later as well as mitigating bias.

## Action Items

- Create an organization system for your notes and any resources you are
  provided with
- Configure Gmail to work for your organizational style: set-up filters, create
  labels, etc.
- Configure your Google Calendar: set your working hours, reserve focus time,
  etc.
- Learn how your team manages documentation as well as your supervisor and your
  larger Business Unit.

## Play 5 Reflection Questions

- When do you feel most “on top of things”? What systems do you put in place to
  aid you?
- When do you feel overwhelmed? How might you adapt your strategies from #1 to
  help you feel less overwhelmed, particularly as you handle supervisory
  responsibilities?

## Play 5 Case Studies

- Your team is starting a project that’s new to all of you. You’ve heard that
  your business unit tried to tackle a similar project years ago, but the
  project was abandoned due to lack of funding. You have found some resources
  and paperwork from the original project. Currently, you have located well over
  100 pages of what appears to be unorganized documents and notes. How will you
  approach this? How might you leverage the old information and/or start anew
- During your first 2 months in the role, the swirl of new information
  overwhelmed you. You are feeling great about the overall direction your team
  is moving, and performance problems have been minimal. But, you haven’t
  consistently written down or tracked any of your direct report’s
  accomplishments. You are about 3 months away from mid-year performance
  reviews: what will you do?
