As you become more comfortable with your new role, you will find that your
deliverables, commitments, and action items will increase exponentially. This
will feel overwhelming at times, even for those who have been a supervisor
previously. **It is not up to you alone to do all of these things**. Instead,
you need to delegate to your team.

Delegation is hard, or at least it feels hard, because of a few reasons:

- You may feel you are giving up control of work that you are responsible for
- You are not sure if you can trust someone else on the team to do the work
- You are unsure of who is most capable to do a task
- You may not know what to delegate that’s currently on your plate
- You may not know who on your team has the capacity or schedule to allow them
  to take on the work

In other words, if delegation is viewed through the lens of coaxing others to do
the work you feel is yours, it will be hard and it will result in a lot of
challenges and frustration.

It takes practice to become comfortable and effective with delegation.
**Delegation is a skill that is critical to your success and ability to deliver
results, and it is also critical to the health and growth of your team(s)**. You
physically cannot do everything yourself, and delegation provides team members
with the opportunity to stretch themselves and learn something new. Shift your
perspective to view your work as the work of the team you supervise (especially
in the case of supervising other supervisors!) and as an opportunity to train
others up with new skills and knowledge.

Delegation gives your team members a chance on new tasks; be sure to make the
time to mentor and coach, as necessary. Eventually, your team members will be
able to take greater ownership and responsibility. This expands and develops the
skills across your team, and primes everyone for their next career opportunities
as well.

There is no magic formula for delegation. Here are several dimensions and
questions you can consider to help decide what to delegate, and to who:

- **Trust-based**: Is this a task that absolutely cannot be missed and/or is
  there no room for error? It probably makes sense to delegate to the person
  whose track record you know the most.
- **Learning-based**: Is this a task that would afford someone the ability to
  learn a new skill, and/or there is room for mistakes or imperfection? This is
  a perfect task to delegate to someone to grow their skills and teach them
  something new!
- **Exposure-based**: Is this a task that would help you advocate or champion
  someone, and provide them with additional exposure in the organization? Tasks
  of this nature are great for someone pursuing leadership opportunities or
  promotion.
- **Capability-based**: Is this a task that requires a deep level of
  knowledge/expertise? This is probably best assigned to a subject matter expert
  (SME) on the team.

Note that none of this is set in stone! Oftentimes, you will have to weigh each
of these dimensions. This requires you to have built strong connections with
each of your team members and understand their capabilities, strengths, growth
opportunities, interests, and motivations. Delegation can be an effective tool
for this, as it will quickly demonstrate how your team members behave and react
to the work.

The [delegation tools list](https://www.managementcenter.org/tools/delegation/)
from The Management Center is full of resources, such as how to clarify
responsibilities, how to be deliberate and intentional when delegating and
prioritizing tasks, knowing what to delegate based on comparative advantage, and
much more.

## Action Items

- Learn about each of your team members: their capabilities, strengths, growth
  opportunities, interests, and motivations; find these out in 1:1s!
- Review the work on your plate: how might delegation be leveraged to train up
  your team members?

## Play 7 Reflection Questions

- What kind of culture currently exists on your team, when it comes to
  delegation? For example, did your predecessor delegate tasks, and if so, how
  did it typically go? What might you want to keep, add, or change about
  delegation on your team?
- How do you handle it when someone completes a task differently than you would
  have? How do you focus on progress versus perfection?

## Play 7 Case Studies

- Your business unit is constantly being assigned high-profile projects. You
  have delegated multiple tasks to several members of your team. You have
  noticed that tasks are not getting completed by the assigned deadlines. When
  you ask your team why they have not completed their delegated tasks, they have
  all said that they are burned out and overwhelmed by multiple, competing
  demands. What are your next steps? What will you do to keep the team
  motivated?
- You have two high performers assigned to your team and both have a history of
  superb performance. They both want to progress in the organization and both
  work hard to ensure the success of projects. You have been assigned a project
  that will be monitored directly by your organization’s Executive Director, who
  has asked you to select the best person to work on the project. How do you
  decide who will work on the project?
