The Enterprise Management Program Management Office (EMPMO) promotes cross-TTS operational efficiency and effectiveness, ensures adequate oversight of risks across the enterprise, and optimizes planning and performance for TTS.

The EMPMO plays a vital role in facilitating compliance-related and micro-purchase activities for TTS. We do this by partnering with each TTS program office on the matters below to ensure timely, accurate, and complete responses:
- Controlled correspondence
- Events and training
- FOIA requests
- GAO and OIG audits
- Micropurchases
- OCFO and GSA-related data calls
- Records management
- Risk assessments and management
- Travel

You can review our current [Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gjJLz17SctoTcKiHWHD0oSAxSidnRv4n?usp=sharing).
