The Business Operations Division leads the day to day operations of the
organization and delivers on the TTS strategy and operational plans.

This division is made up of four teams and responsible for the following
functions:

# Agreements

The TTS Agreements Team works with business units to ensure Interagency
Agreements (IAAs), Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs), and Intergovernmental
Cooperation Act Agreements (IGCAs) are completed before providing or receiving
services to or from partner agencies, offices, state or local governments. The
team works closely with TTS business units and partners, as well as the TTS
finance team, OCFO, and OGC to ensure our agreements are in compliance with
legal and financial guidance. We track agreements from the time they are
requested by a business unit until they are fully executed and processed. The
team also provides data and business intelligence to help leadership forecast
business volume and develop business development strategies.

each TTS business unit as well as provide business intelligence to support
