TTS Talent attracts the most passionate, talented individuals from across the
public and private sectors, offering them unique professional development
opportunities, top-notch customer service, and fulfilling, impactful work that
transforms how the public interacts with the government.

While the name might be misleading, the Talent Team is primarily focused on
talent acquisition/hiring and onboarding, whereas the People Ops team is focused
on assisting current employees with issues related to benefits, performance
management, and learning and development opportunities.

## Talent Team Overview

### Our Mission

provided the opportunity to deliver high impact public service.

### How We Work

We are a team that works collaboratively, transparently and vulnerably. Where
everyone has a role to play but success is not determined by an individualâ€™s
output, it is determined by the whole team delivering on the mission.

### Team Values

- Collaboration
- Strategic Thinking

### Key Objectives

1. Attract and hire well-qualified candidates 
2. Strategically partner with leadership to understand and advise on the people
   needs of the organization
3. Use data to make well informed decisions about the recruitment and onboarding
   process
4. Foster relationships internally and externally



## Referring a person

Many leads for great candidates come through our current employees. 
**These referrals should come directly to Talent rather than to the
team/managers/supervisors**. We work to keep all mentions of who knows who and
who recommends who away from the team/managers/supervisors who are involved in
hiring so they can stay impartial and ensure we are following the [Merit Systems Principles](https://www.mspb.gov/msp/meritsystemsprinciples.htm). 
This helps ensure that candidates make it
through the process on their own merits.

Once you have submitted a referral, a talent team member will reach out and
invite the person to our monthly general TTS Info Session. We share information
about all of TTS at the Info Session as well as provide guidance on the
application process. If we have a role specific Info Session scheduled (i.e. for
Product or Engineering) we will invite your referral if it's applicable. Talent doesn't have individual conversations with
referrals.

We accept varying levels of leads including:

- Referrals: You know them really well (e.g. someone you worked closely with or
  a good friend)
- Warm Leads: You kind-of know them (e.g. someone you worked with but not
  directly)
- Cold Leads: You barely know them at all (e.g. someone you heard speak at a
  conference or wrote a memorable blog post)

Submit leads and referrals using the
[Referral Submission Form](https://goo.gl/forms/I6cOnRNdh21aP5e63).
[More information on the referral program.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GY57s0tXahSwTaLzHEuR6falwQcNh7nbCnRnLoQppdQ/edit)
Leads and referrals are welcome any time, not just during times when positions
are open.

Please note: In accordance to GSA Order 9310.2, Restrictions on Employment of
Relatives, no public official shall refer a relative to another public official
for consideration for appointment, employment, promotion, or advancement to any
position in GSA.
