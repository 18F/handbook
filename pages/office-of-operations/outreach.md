TTS Outreach is responsible for the TTS brand with audiences both internal and
external to the government. It exists to drive demand for TTS services in
support of the overall mission to improve the public’s experience with the
government by helping agencies build, buy, and share technology that allows them
to better serve the public.

The team works closely with the GSA Office of Strategic Communication to ensure
all communications meet GSA standards and align with GSA’s mission. Outreach
achieves its goals through:

- Brand management
- Online presence (web, social, etc.) strategy
- Email communications
- Customer engagement
- Demand generation efforts
- Constituent education

## Services

Outreach is part of TTS Clients & Markets and is funded by the TTS business
units. Come talk to the Outreach team if you’d like help with:

- Reviewing and approving public content, including marketing materials and
  websites
- Learning about emerging technology communications and training tools
- Creating a communication and social engagement strategy
- Writing a conference talk
- Connecting with the Office of Strategic Communication regarding press
  requests, GSA communication channels, or approvals
- Editing TTS content on InSite or GSA.gov

If you're contacted by a journalist or member of the press, please forward the
message to press@gsa.gov without responding. All press interactions are handled
by the Office of Strategic Communication.

## Slack channels

- {% slack_channel "outreach" %} is for all general inquiries including helping
  you promote things, members of the press asking you questions, guidance on
  getting content approved etc.
- {% slack_channel "tweet-this" %} is where we coordinate activity for TTS
  Twitter accounts. Hop in here if you’d like an official account to tweet
  something or respond to a tweet.
- {% slack_channel "press" %} is for collecting press mentions of TTS. If you
  see something inaccurate in a story posted in press, you can contact the
  Outreach team to see if we can get it corrected.
- {% slack_channel "training-conferences" %}: This channel is not managed by the
  Outreach team, but this is where you go if you’ve been asked to speak at an
  event, or if you want to speak at an event and may need approval. Outreach can
  help you with content for a talk, but the Governance and Compliance team
  handles approvals.
