## Creating a new performance plan

In most cases, supervisors should own the creation of performance plans for
direct reports. This step applies to employees who require a new performance
plan such as new employees and existing employees who have recently changed
roles.

- Step-by-step instructions:

    - **_Note: Supervisors should create a new or clone (see below) an existing
      Peformance Plan for their direct report(s)_**

## Copying an existing performance plan

In most cases, supervisors should own the creation of performance plans for
direct reports. This step applies to employees that will be on a performance
plan that is consistent with their prior year.

## Updating a performance plan

After creating or copying (cloning) a prior year performance plan, updates to
the critical elements, specifics measures and/or rating expectation levels will
likely be needed to align with current fiscal year goals. This section provides
resources, including prior year examples, for updating performance plans.

## Re-opening a performance plan

If modifications need to be made to an existing performance plan, a plan can be
re-opened by the Supervisor and [resubmitted to the employee to
acknowledge]({% page "/performance-management/end-of-year/hrlinks-steps/#submitting-a-performance-plan-for-employee-approval" %}).

**_NOTE: 120 days must pass from the date the employee acknowledges the updated
plan before they can be rated against it._**

## Nominating participant reviewer(s)

This process allows supervisors and employees to
[solicit feedback](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1O3G3fa2ezbz_SUqBRT3OZRt0QPrLapl6)
from other supervisors or colleagues regarding their Performance Plan. HR Links
allows both employees and supervisors to nominate and track participant reviews;
however, only supervisors can officially submit a nomination. If an employee
nominates another employee for feedback on their performance, the nomination is
submitted to the
[supervisor for approval](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1V9gF5BB6z78mm9gr8sHhdP70jzKa9j7t5DlSChNG9-c/edit?usp=sharing).
**You must inform your Supervisor that you have submitted the nomination(s) for
approval because HR Links does NOT notify them of this action.**

Once nominated, participant reviewers receive a notification alerting them of
the evaluation request. The employee's supervisor is required to review and
approve all feedback from participant reviews.

_NOTE: A participant reviewer will need to
[“Accept” or “Decline”](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13VNcGwXrT6Esse2mfpGjJ-DZFbX8f_iqAaJlhpwuSCk/edit?usp=sharing)
to provide feedback, if nominated, and will only be able to see the employee
appraisal information that they provided._

## Submitting a participant review

Submitting a participant review in HR Links is the same process for all
nominated colleagues regardless of their reporting relationship to the employee.
TTS Supervisors will have to review and approve all participant reviews for
their direct reports in HR Links as part of the final employee evaluation
submittal process.

It is critical that all performance plan evaluations are acknowledged and all
new fiscal year performance plans are acknowledged (established) by employees by
GSA deadline. The status of employee performance management can be checked in
the _Team Performance Supervisor dashboard_:

## Closing out an interim performance plan (the plan will not factor into the end of year performance award)

If a TTS employees has two performance plans of record, both plans need to be
closed out; however, only the most recent plan will factor into the end of year
performance award if the other plan is closed out properly. Supervisors should
discuss both plans with their direct reports and provide ratings that are as
accurate as possible because both plans will still be visible in the employee's
record. The step-by-step instructions below show how to rate and submit the
"old" plan properly.

- Step-by-step instructions:
  - No action required by employee
  - Supervisor will need to
    [follow these instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10WP9J0MeH-PovXlZqXvkAH_ePQuHaPnXZnou2FEq0_I/edit)

## Selecting Time Off Award in lieu of cash performance award

Information will be updated pending guidance from GSA.
