## Who participates in the end of year performance review?

A GSA employee is eligible to be rated by their official Supervisor if they have
been on an established Performance Plan for 120 days, beginning with the date
that the employee acknowledged the performance plan that was signed by their
Supervisor.

For employees who need a new performance plan to be established **after June
1**, their supervisor should partner with our
[Workforce Relations partner](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15glvq9UakKUN8XTRTa6gRkhBHm2whhQyAGmf8ibTtBs/edit)
for guidance.

Employees who start **after September 1** are not eligible to participate in the
upcoming end-of-year performance review cycle. The employee's supervisor should
partner with TTS PeopleOps for guidance.

**PLEASE NOTE:** New performance plans should be established within 30 days of
an employee entering a role.

### Who is eligible for the end of year performance bonus?

Employees who occupy eligible positions as of September 30, 2022, and who
receive an eligible rating of record, will receive an Individual Performance
Award (IPA). “Ratings of Record (Annual)” should be completed in HR Links by
November 14, or that employee may not receive their award timely.

Subject to the availability of funds, OCFO and OHRM plan to distribute IPAs as
follows:

- **Level 5 summary ratings:** Up to 3.85% of adjusted basic pay, or up to 80
  hours of time off, subject to budget availability.
- **Level 4 summary ratings:** Up to 2.1% of adjusted basic pay, or up to 44
  hours of time off subject to budget availability.
- **"High 3" summary ratings:** Up to 0.385% of adjusted basic pay, or up to 8
  hours of time off subject to budget availability for employees who receive a
  Level 3 summary rating with one or more critical elements weighted 15% or
  greater, rated at Level 4 or Level 5.

The final award percentages for Level 5, Level 4 and Level 3 summary ratings
will be determined **when all performance reviews are complete**. In the event
the above targets for the Level 3, Level 4 and Level 5 summary ratings cannot be
met due to budget constraints, the percentage payouts for awards will be
decreased proportionally. Summary ratings are not an average score —
[they are assigned as defined on InSite](https://insite.gsa.gov/topics/hr-pay-and-leave/performance-management/performance-management-appraising).

IPAs are targeted to be **paid out in December 2022**, as in previous years.
However, the IPA payout date depends upon the status of the Continuing
Resolution and FY22 funding.

### Selecting award preference in HR Links

If you are eligible for an end-of-year individual performance award (cash or
time-off), **please make a selection no later than November 15th.** If you would
like to keep the same selection type as FY21, no further action is needed.

- **Monetary award:** This is the default option in HR Links. No action is
  needed in HR Links **unless you specified award time off for the prior review
  cycle**

  - To change from **LEAVE** to **CASH**, you need to change your “Time Off
    Award Preference” to **“Inactive”** and you must then use the **“Save”**
    button.
  - **_Note:_** These
    [instructions](https://corporateapps.gsa.gov/files/TimeOffAwardPreference.pdf)
    show where to make the change in HR Links

- **Award leave:** If you would like to select award time off in lieu of a
  monetary award, please follow
  [these instructions](https://corporateapps.gsa.gov/files/TimeOffAwardPreference.pdf).
