employee if the employee is unable to (i.e. on vacation) or refuses to do so
(i.e. does not agree with the evaluation).

- Step-by-step instructions:
  - No action required by employee
  - [Supervisor](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iduOW_V1NNqGnZkm7TAwzzr4oIZPZW3UG-f1QdaLD-w/edit#heading=h.g8d9qupcsxiz)

## Re-opening a performance plan

If modifications need to be made to an existing performance plan, a plan can be
re-opened by the Supervisor and [resubmitted to the employee to
acknowledge]({% page "/performance-management/end-of-year/hrlinks-steps/#submitting-a-performance-plan-for-employee-approval" %}).

**_NOTE: 120 days must pass from the date the employee acknowledges the updated
plan before they can be rated against it. Please refer to the ["Who can
participate in end of year performance
reviews?"]({% page "/performance-management/#who-participates-in-the-end-of-year-performance-review" %})
section for more information._**

- Step-by-step instructions:
  - No action required by employee
  - [Supervisor](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iduOW_V1NNqGnZkm7TAwzzr4oIZPZW3UG-f1QdaLD-w/edit#heading=h.crvn3012hsrk)

## Entering a self-assessment

Self-assessments are **not required** for the mid year review; however,
Supervisors can request that their direct reports submit one.

- Step-by-step instructions:

  - [Employee](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VxwbatliieP78-qN_VmdHxt1ROvSro4yKe9-OkjQd58/edit#heading=h.2bzg793t31vu)
    - We **strongly recommend** that you draft your self-assessment using
      Google Docs to avoid losing it if HRLinks crashes due to inactivity. If
      you want to draft your self-assessment directly in HRLinks, make sure to
      frequently click the "Save" button to preserve your work.
    - If you need to make adjustments, you can ["stop sharing" the self-assessment](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VxwbatliieP78-qN_VmdHxt1ROvSro4yKe9-OkjQd58/edit#heading=h.ftv2w8inxo6) with your Supervisor as long as their Mid-Year has not been completed.
