## Union requirements for mid year performance reviews

- **AFGE Union members:** a rating is required for each critical element of the
  performance plan and you must also inform the employee whether their overall
  performance to date remains consistent with the summary rating received on the
  last annual rating of record.
- **NFFE Union members:** a rating is NOT required for each critical element but
  you must inform the employee whether their overall performance to date
  remains consistent with the summary rating received on the last annual rating
  of record. It is recommended that manager comments are documented in the GSA
  Elements Summary section in HR Links.
- **Non-union employees:** a rating and/or comments is not required.
