## Union requirements for end of year performance reviews

### AFGE Union members & NFFE Union members

There are two requirements for Bargaining Unit Employees under the current
contract:

1. A justification for a summary **rating other than Level 3** must be completed
   in writing and made a part of the employee's performance appraisal file. Each
   employee will be given a copy of the rating and any related documentation.
2. The employee's written comments about the final performance plan and the
   actual signed performance plan, which are placed in the supervisory
   performance file, will be provided to the employee prior to being placed in
   the file. Any documents used during the mid-year, interim, or final
   appraisal, placed in the supervisory performance file, will be shown to the
   employee at the time of the discussion; the supervisor will notify the
   employee that he/she will be provided copies upon request.

Please reach out to your
[Workforce Relations partner](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15glvq9UakKUN8XTRTa6gRkhBHm2whhQyAGmf8ibTtBs/edit) if you have additional questions or concerns.

  - Instructions if you receive the error message "The document could not be
    created as the employee is not hired yet. Please contact your system
    administrator to check the Job record to make sure employee is hired before
    period begin date of the document."
    - _Note: The rating period begin must be set after the hire date in HR
      Links. It is recommended that the supervisor copy the overall performance
      comments into HR Links because the comments will then populate on Form
      3440 to support the overall rating_

### Discussing performance expectations with a new direct report

When an employee joins TTS or changes supervisors within TTS, it is important
that the supervisor establish new performance expectations with the employee
through dialogue and ultimately in the official [performance
plan]({% page "/performance-management/end-of-year/hrlinks-steps/#creating-a-new-performance-plan" %}).
Performance expectations must be developed to describe the expected level of
performance at a Level 3 rating; supervisors are encouraged to establish
performance expectations for other levels if deemed appropriate.

- Suggestions of performance expectations that you can discuss and set with your
  direct report:

  - improvements in effectiveness, productivity, and performance quality
  - cost efficiency
  - timeliness of performance
  - customer service

- Performance expectations should:

  - align with GSA, business, office, work unit, team goals and objectives
  - be attainable, but challenging
  - be clearly worded and measurable

- [InSite Performance Management Guide](https://insite.gsa.gov/topics/hr-pay-and-leave/performance-management/planning-performance)
  - Page 19 - Managers Guide End of Year Review & Establishing Expectations

### Performance improvement and performance action plans

At any point during the year, if an employee's performance in one or more
critical element(s) or sub-element(s) is considered less than Level 3, Fully
Successful, the employee should be notified right away.

Reach out to your
[Workforce Relations partner](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15glvq9UakKUN8XTRTa6gRkhBHm2whhQyAGmf8ibTtBs/edit) for guidance.

Please also reference the
[Supervisor Checklist for Addressing Poor Performance](https://insite.gsa.gov/cdnstatic/insite/SupervisorChecklistforAddressingPoorPerformance.docx)
on the
[Performance Management Resources](https://insite.gsa.gov/topics/hr-pay-and-leave/performance-management/performance-management-resources)
InSite page.

### Verifying your direct reports

In preparation for an upcoming Employee Performance Review cycle, please conduct
an audit of your Direct Reports in HR Links by following the instructions in the
[Direct Report Audit Survey](https://forms.gle/oLtit3o2MLsSUonx5).

### 1 on 1 performance conversation

This meeting is an opportunity to rate, recognize and give your direct report
constructive feedback (formal or informal) regarding the results of their work
within the established expectations, goals, and objectives outlined in the
performance plan.

**_See below for how to prepare for this meeting._**

### Preparing for 1 on 1 performance conversation

Gather emails, written performance counseling, customer feedback, survey
results, supervisory notes, database/spreadsheets, and/or work samples about the
employee’s performance that you observed within the current rating cycle.
Prepare feedback for your direct reports that's backed with specific data points
and examples, regardless of whether it will be constructive criticism or praise.
When providing constructive criticism, it is recommended that you have clear
examples of the desired behavior.

Here’s a pre-feedback checklist you may want to consider:

- Have you prepared a balanced list of key strengths and development areas to
  discuss?
- Were any of the current developmental areas discussed previously? If so, how
  are you incorporating that into the upcoming feedback session?
- Is your feedback fair, accurate, and directly applicable to the employee’s
  performance requirements?
- Do your comments focus on single behaviors that direct the employee’s
  attention to specific and important improvements?
- Are you prepared to share specific examples of each strength and/or
  development area?
- Can you describe actions or behaviors the individual can change?
- Are your comments straightforward without adding caveats?
- Do you have a plan for regular check-ins to ensure consistent and ongoing
  development and improvement?

### Submitting an evaluation for a direct report who isn't assigned to their supervisor in HR Links

For instances when a direct report is not assigned to their first line
supervisor in HR Links or their supervisor doesn't have HR Links manager access,
there are two primary options for the first line supervisor to be able to
contribute to the evaluation:

1. The first line supervisor should have a 1:1 performance conversation with
   their direct report and then email their evaluation to the second line
   supervisor who will [submit the
   evaluation]({% page "/performance-management/end-of-year/hrlinks-steps/#submitting-an-evaluation" %})
   in HR Links on the first line supervisor's behalf.

- **_NOTE: If the employee has submitted a self-assessment in HR Links, the
  second line supervisor should email or print a copy for the first line
  supervisor to review prior to the 1:1 meeting._**

2. The second line supervisor can [nominate the first line supervisor as a
   participant
   reviewer]({% page "/performance-management/end-of-year/hrlinks-steps/#nominating-participant-reviewer-s" %})
   so that the first line supervisor can submit an evaluation for their direct
   report in HR Links after the 1:1 conversation.

- **_NOTE: The nominated supervisor's feedback is not automatically included as
  a comment in the employees performance review. HR Links creates a separate
  document, so it is recommended that the second line supervisor cuts and paste
  the feedback into the summary comments._**

### Approving/Denying a level 1 or level 5 summary performance rating

If an employee has received a Summary Rating of Level 1 or 5, the evaluation
will automatically be routed to the employee’s 2nd level supervisor (the
supervisor of the employee’s supervisor) for approval. To approve or deny a
Summary Rating of Level 1 or 5, the employee’s 2nd Level Supervisor must follow
the instructions below:

- HR Links in-depth guide (with screenshots):
  - [Supervisor (Section 4, Topic 4.1)](https://drive.google.com/open?id=15Xm9NF_KfcWN-ZxPomooowEAq51073Xi)

### Cancelling an HR Links evaluation

The only time a supervisor may want to cancel an evaluation is when an employee
separates and evaluation cannot be completed or it’s not necessary. Only and HR
Admin can cancel “submitted” evaluations. Please contact your
[Workforce Relations partner](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15glvq9UakKUN8XTRTa6gRkhBHm2whhQyAGmf8ibTtBs/edit) to initiate this process.

### Overriding an HR Links employee acknowledgement

A supervisor may need to approve an employee performance plan or employee
evaluation on behalf of their employee if the employee is unable to (i.e. on
vacation) or refuses to do so (i.e. does not agree with the evaluation).

### Leveraging diversity performance measure

All **supervisory performance plans** must include the “Leveraging Diversity”
measure. [Guidance on adding this to supervisory plans](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LPe6rKUze_tA3OfHhRLUfLSQtY4m8d4J3k4OZq2oFcY/edit#heading=h.7ki5n23m5zhy).

### Acquisition Critical Element

All CORs on active delegation must have the new Acquisition Critical Element on
their Performance Plan. [Guidance on adding this critical element to performance plans](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hOu4GtwpjCAUXenXNE7Vit3O3ldDYSRb/view).
