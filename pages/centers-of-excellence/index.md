## Our Story

A signature initiative designed by the White House's Office of American
Innovation (OAI) and implemented at the General Services Administration (GSA),
the Centers of Excellence (CoE) seek to address IT modernization as a means to
improve citizen services. We were established in October 2017 within the GSA's
Technology Transformation Services (TTS) to support intensive IT transformation
at federal agencies.

Our mission is to accelerate that modernization by leveraging private sector
innovation and government services, while centralizing best practices and
expertise for holistic transformation.

We have six centers, each focused on a specific (but interconnected) area of
transformation:

- **Artificial Intelligence**
  - Accelerates adoption of Artificial Intelligence to discover insights at
    machine speed.
- **Cloud Adoption**
  - Analyzes current systems and applications to provide recommendations for
    planning cloud migration.
- **Contact Center**
  - Helps improve contact center delivery services and customer interactions.
- **Customer Experience**
  - Works to develop a better understanding of customer needs and helps
    translate those findings into actions.
- **Data Analytics**
  - Helps make more efficient use of data management, analysis, and reporting
    capabilities.
- **Infrastructure Optimization**
  - Assists in optimizing data centers and reducing infrastructure costs.

## Our Values

- **Lead**
  - Take the opportunity to propose solutions to problems to our customers.
- **Consider the CoE vision**
  - Look for opportunities that create a multiple CoE solution.
- **Build Relationships**
  - Get to know members of each CoE---you'll never know how their background and
    perspective can assist in overcoming a challenge.
- **Know our customer**
  - Understanding and anticipating the needs of our customer is our highest
    priority. Speaking with our customers and regularly gathering their insights
    allows agencies to rethink the way they deliver technology solutions today.
- **Innovate from within**
  - There is a lot of great technical talent across the government, we strive to
    identify those innovators and harness their experience in the CoEs.
- **Collaborate for success**
  - The CoEs recruit the best and brightest from our customer's workforce to
    co-lead modernization efforts and ensure success and longevity beyond CoE
    engagements.
- **Rely on best practices**
  - We also partner with the private sector to implement the latest technology,
    utilize commercial practices, accelerate modernization and avoid common
    pitfalls.
- **Centralize our resources**
  - By standing up the CoEs we strive to centralize and share the brightest
    talent, proven processes and acquisition vehicles to yield the best results
    across government.
