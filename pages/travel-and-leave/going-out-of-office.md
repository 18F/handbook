## Your overall responsibilities

You must report to work or have an approved leave request in HR Links, every scheduled work day. You are also responsible for submitting your timesheet at the end of every pay period.

You should submit leave requests at least three business days in advance, and make timely edits if your plans change.

For unplanned leave \- such as a sudden illness or a family emergency \- do what you can to contact your supervisor, and they can help manage the rest on your behalf.

Some types of leave require supporting documentation: it is your responsibility to submit all necessary documents and check that you’ve received approval. Various scenarios are documented below, along with contact information for help.

### Notifying GSA of international travel, for security clearance holders

If you are traveling internationally and hold a security clearance, you are required to notify GSA. Follow the [guidance on international travel for clearance holders](https://insite.gsa.gov/services-and-offices/staff-offices/office-of-mission-assurance/divisions-program-offices/personnel-security-division/foreign-travel-information-page) in InSite. This notification is optional if you do not hold a clearance.

## Time tracking

Billable TTS employees taking leave should follow the Handbook guidance on [how to Tock when on leave]({% page "/tools/tock/#tocking-for-out-of-office-time" %}).

Reminder: HR Links is separate from Tock. If you’re taking time off, you’ll need to make sure you’re accounted for in both systems.

### Advanced sick leave approval

To get approval for advanced sick leave, you will need to submit the following paperwork to your supervisors and your [OHRM Workforce Relations HR Specialist](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15glvq9UakKUN8XTRTa6gRkhBHm2whhQyAGmf8ibTtBs/edit\#heading=h.65ckjyv9pbpl). Your supervisors should keep signed copies for their records:

1. [Advanced Sick Leave Request form](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zxQN5c4ZRMcxN7u5hcM3LFEURZLuoHLIBwGOKEzldqk/edit\#) with signatures
2. An original medical certification signed by the physician or practitioner
3. A copy of your [timesheet report for the current and previous year]({% page "/travel-and-leave/leave/#pulling-a-time-sheet-report" %})
4. A written explanation of the circumstances which have caused your sick leave to be exhausted

## Checklist for going out of office

Before taking leave, be sure to:

1. Submit a leave request through HR Links. Discuss the dates with your supervisor, as needed.
2. Mark your out of office time on your calendar (inviting your supervisor/colleagues as appropriate with the invite set to "free" so it doesn't block other scheduling) and any applicable team or project calendars.
   1. [Google Calendar has an OOO setting](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/7638168?hl=en\&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop\&oco=0) that can auto-reject current and future meetings.
3. Decline, cancel, or reschedule any meetings you’ll miss.
4. Tell team members or partners via Slack or email, and make sure your work is covered.
   1. Notify your Engagement Manager, Account Manager, and project lead, if applicable.
5. Set up an email auto-responder as appropriate. This should include both when you’ll be back and a point of contact/team email for while you’re out.
   1. For example: I am out of the office on Wednesday January 2nd and will respond to your request when I return on Thursday the 3rd. If you need immediate assistance please email \[email address\] and your request will be directed to the appropriate party.
6. Update your Slack status to indicate that you are OOO.
   1. You can also [set up a Slackbot reminder](https://slack.com/help/articles/208423427-Set-a-reminder) to prompt you to turn off OOO statuses when you return: /remind me to “Update my OOO reminder” on \[date you return\]
7. 18F team members should also:
   1. Submit [correct Tock entries]({% page "/tools/tock/#tocking-for-out-of-office-time" %})
   2. Update your Slack username and profile (ex: @username | OOO until 7/12 | she)
   3. Product chapter members: add an event to the [All Things Product](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=gsa.gov\_dkgkep8b6fj5ge1s2m0cn4srog%40group.calendar.google.com) calendar.

### Returning from leave

Upon returning from leave, remember to:

* Change your Slack name/status back to normal
* Turn off your email auto-response
