The Voluntary Leave Transfer Program (VLTP) allows TTS employees to donate annual leave directly to another employee who has a personal or family medical emergency. 

## To receive donated hours
### Eligibility
To be eligible for VLTP, you must have all of the following:
- Exhausted all leave balances (annual, sick, award)
- Have an anticipated negative leave balance of at least 24 hours
- A medical condition for you or a family member that is likely to require your absence for a prolonged period of time (24 work hours or more)

### Enrolling in VLTP to receive donated hours

1. Complete your portion of the VLTP application,
   [OPM Form 630](https://www.opm.gov/forms/pdf_fill/opm630.pdf). 
   - You'll need to fill out Sections 1-11, 14, 16a and 16b.   
   - On the form, fill out information about the medical condition when the labels mention “medical emergency.”   
   - Your supervisor can help you fill out the form.  
2. Gather supporting medical documentation. The medical documentation must include the following:
   - Nature of medical emergency
   - Prognosis of the medical condition
   - Duration of the medical condition
   - The medical documentation must be signed by your physician or other practitioner.
3. Send Form 630 and supporting documentation to your supervisor.
4. Your supervisor completes their portion of Form 630. 
   - They need to fill out Sections 12, 13, and 17.
5. Your supervisor emails Form 630 and the supporting medication documentation to your [Workforce Relations HR Specialist](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15glvq9UakKUN8XTRTa6gRkhBHm2whhQyAGmf8ibTtBs/edit).
6. Your [Workforce Relations HR Specialist](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15glvq9UakKUN8XTRTa6gRkhBHm2whhQyAGmf8ibTtBs/edit) will review the application, and notify you and your supervisor if your request is approved (within 10 business days). They will provide you with a reason if the request is not approved, and what, if anything, can be done to resubmit.  
7. Your supervisor sends out an announcement email TTS-wide.

#### VLTP email announcement template

Once VLTP is approved, your supervisor can use the [VLTP email template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eKSbEvUUibZ0LDGqwS_3UO9iBMdYc5VfLN8aNttEQVs/edit) to draft an announcement. Your supervisor will work with Outreach to send an email TTS-wide to [tts@gsa.gov](mailto:tts@gsa.gov), CCing your [Workforce Relations HR Specialist](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15glvq9UakKUN8XTRTa6gRkhBHm2whhQyAGmf8ibTtBs/edit).

### Using donated hours
Donated leave won’t necessarily come in all at once. You will receive  donated leave as it’s donated; so, you and your supervisor will want to touch base as it’s coming in.

* You can check how many donated hours you’ve received in HR Links (same as how you would see annual and sick leave balances). It will also appear on your paystub in Employee Express.  
* You can make adjustments to leave requests in HR Links once you receive VLTP donations. Donated hours can retroactively be substituted for Leave Without Pay (LWOP), advanced annual leave, and advanced sick leave. Work with your supervisor or PeopleOps to amend past timesheets.  
* If you return to work part-time while still using donated leave, you’ll resume earning annual leave and sick leave. As you earn hours, you must use those newly accrued hours first, before any donated leave.

### Un-enrolling from VLTP
1. Notify your supervisor of the date you wish to withdraw from VLTP. This is typically when your medical emergency is resolved.   
2. Check your leave balances in [HR Links](https://hrlinks.gsa.gov/) to ensure that your donated hours have been used. All unused VLTP hours will be returned to the colleagues that donated to you. Double check that your annual and/or sick leave balances are *not* negative. If a leave balance is negative, you can amend past leave requests.   
3. Once you’ve finished amending timecards, your supervisor notifies your [Workforce Relations HR Specialist](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15glvq9UakKUN8XTRTa6gRkhBHm2whhQyAGmf8ibTtBs/edit).  
4. Your [Workforce Relations HR Specialist](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15glvq9UakKUN8XTRTa6gRkhBHm2whhQyAGmf8ibTtBs/edit) will work with Payroll to remove you from the VLTP program.
