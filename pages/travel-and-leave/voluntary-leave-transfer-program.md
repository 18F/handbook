This page provides instructions for enrolling in, donating, and receiving leave
from the Voluntary Leave Transfer Program (VLTP).

Under the VLTP, you may donate annual leave directly to another employee who has
a personal or family medical emergency and who has exhausted their available
paid leave.

## Eligibility for VLTP

To be eligible for VLTP, you must have exhausted all leave balances (annual,
sick, award) and have an anticipated negative balance of at least 24 leave
hours.

**AND**

A) You have experienced a medical emergency.

**OR**

B) A medical condition - yours or a family member’s - is likely to require your
absence for a prolonged period of time (24 work hours or more).

## Donating leave

If you wish to donate leave, you will need to use MAX.gov to access the
[VLTP system](https://vltp.gsa.gov/).

### Registering with MAX.gov

If your GSA email address is not registered with MAX.gov, you will need to
register [via the MAX.gov homepage](https://portal.max.gov/portal/home) prior to
accessing the VLTP website.

Select the **Register Now** button at the top right of that homepage and follow
the prompts to register your PIV card and enable login (or use the email
option).

### Donating hours through VLTP

- Go to [https://vltp.gsa.gov/](https://vltp.gsa.gov/) and log in using your PIV
  card or GSA email with 2-factor authentication
- You will be taken to the GSA Payroll System VLTP page
- Click the button on the bottom to **Donate Annual Leave Hours To A Shared
  Leave Recipient**
- Follow the system prompts to donate leave; select **General Services
  Administration** as the agency and **0 - Central Office** as the region.
- Note: once you donate, you will see a message that says
  `You MUST also notify your timekeeper of the number of annual leave hours you have donated so they can update your Annual Attendance Record (GSA Form 873).`
  You can ignore this message: this step is not needed.

If you have any questions, please email our
[Workforce Relations HR Specialist](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15glvq9UakKUN8XTRTa6gRkhBHm2whhQyAGmf8ibTtBs/edit).

## Enrolling in VLTP to receive donated hours

1. Complete your portion of the VLTP application,
   [OPM Form 630](https://www.opm.gov/forms/pdf_fill/opm630.pdf). You'll need to
   fill out Sections 1 -11, 14, 16a and 16b. Your supervisor can help you fill
   out the form, if needed.
2. Gather supporting medical documentation. The medical documentation must
   include the following:

   - Nature of medical emergency
   - Prognosis of the medical condition
   - Duration of the medical condition
   - The medical documentation must be signed by your physician or other
     practitioner.

3. Send Form 630 and supporting documentation to your supervisor.
4. Your supervisor completes their portion of Form 630. They need to fill out
   Sections 12, 13, and 17.
5. Your supervisor emails Form 630 and the supporting medication documentation
   to our
   [Workforce Relations HR Specialist](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15glvq9UakKUN8XTRTa6gRkhBHm2whhQyAGmf8ibTtBs/edit).
6. Our
   [Workforce Relations HR Specialist](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15glvq9UakKUN8XTRTa6gRkhBHm2whhQyAGmf8ibTtBs/edit)
   will review the application, and notify you and your supervisor if your
   request is approved (within 10 business days). They will provide you with a
   reason if the request is not approved, and what, if anything, can be done to
   resubmit.
7. Your supervisor follows the announcement guidance below to send out an email
   TTS-wide.

## VLTP Announcement Guidance

Once VLTP is approved, your supervisor can use the
[VLTP email template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eKSbEvUUibZ0LDGqwS_3UO9iBMdYc5VfLN8aNttEQVs/edit)
to draft an announcement.

- Your supervisor will work with Outreach to send one initial email TTS-wide to
  tts@gsa.gov. Please CC our
  [Workforce Relations HR Specialist](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15glvq9UakKUN8XTRTa6gRkhBHm2whhQyAGmf8ibTtBs/edit).
- You and your supervisor should not send follow-up emails.

## Using Donated Hours

Donated leave won’t necessarily come in all at once. You will bank donated leave
as it’s donated; so you and your supervisor will want to touch base as it’s
coming in.

- You can check how many donated hours you’ve received in HRLinks (same as how
  you would see annual and sick leave balances). It will also appear on your
  paystub in Employee Express.
- You can make adjustments to leave requests in HRLinks once you receive VLTP
  donations. Donated hours can retroactively be substituted for LWOP, advanced
  annual leave and advanced sick leave. Work with your supervisor or PeopleOps
  to amend past timesheets.
- If you return to work part-time while still using donated leave, you’ll resume
  earning annual leave and sick leave. As you earn hours, you must use those
  newly accrued hours first, before any donated leave.

## Un-enrolling from VLTP

When your medical emergency is over:

1. Notify your supervisor of the date when your emergency ends (or the date you
   want to be removed from the VLTP program, if you wish to withdraw before the
   end of your emergency).
1. Check your leave balances in [HRLinks](https://hrlinks.gsa.gov/) to make sure
   that your annual and/or sick leave balances are _not_ negative. If a leave
   balance is negative, work with #people-ops to amend old time cards with
   donated leave hours. All unused VLTP hours will be returned to the colleagues
   that donated to you.
1. Once you’ve finished amending timecards, your supervisor notifies our
   [Workforce Relations HR Specialist](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15glvq9UakKUN8XTRTa6gRkhBHm2whhQyAGmf8ibTtBs/edit).
1. Our
   [Workforce Relations HR Specialist](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15glvq9UakKUN8XTRTa6gRkhBHm2whhQyAGmf8ibTtBs/edit)
   will work with Payroll to remove you from the VLTP program.
