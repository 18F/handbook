You can request up to 240 hours of advanced sick leave. If you are a term employee, you can request up to the total amount that youâ€™ll earn during the rest of your term.

For example: You have one year left on your term, which equals to 26 pay periods. You earn 4 sick leave hours per pay period. You will earn 104 more sick leave hours (26 pay periods x 4 hours per pay period). Therefore, you can request up to 104 advanced sick leave hours.

## Getting approval for advanced sick leave

To get approval for advanced sick leave, you will need to submit the following paperwork to your supervisors and your [OHRM Workforce Relations HR Specialist](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15glvq9UakKUN8XTRTa6gRkhBHm2whhQyAGmf8ibTtBs/edit#heading=h.65ckjyv9pbpl). Note: we suggest drafting all 4 pieces of paperwork and sending them to your HR Specialist for review *before* routing for official signatures in Docusign.

1. [Advanced Sick Leave Request form](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zxQN5c4ZRMcxN7u5hcM3LFEURZLuoHLIBwGOKEzldqk/edit#). Your supervisor can complete and route this form for you, if needed.  
2. An original medical certification signed by your physician or practitioner.  
3. A copy of your timesheet report for the current and previous year. Your supervisor can [pull a timesheet report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HIJQKVhzCtrW5Pc0rzynwdSj0ltmyR1p/view) for you, if needed.  
4. A written explanation of the circumstances which have caused your sick leave to be exhausted. Include how many hours you are requesting. Your supervisor can write this explanation for you, if needed.

When routing for signatures, you can use the [Docusign template]({% page "/tools/digital-signatures#use-docusign-templates-to-complete-forms" %}) for the Advanced Sick Leave Request to fill out the form and request the right signatures.

Your supervisors should keep signed copies for their records.
