GSA continues to adjust to the changing COVID-19 pandemic status. Effective
immediately as of July 13, any requests for travel must be mission critical,
time sensitive and required to perform essential duties. The employee’s
authorizing official (AO) is responsible for making the determination if travel
requests meet that threshold. Of note:

- Travel should not occur if the requirement can be met using virtual
  technology.
- Only the minimum number of employees required to meet the urgent need should
  travel.
- Travelers should work with administrative and budget staff in their
  organization to ensure any personal protective equipment (PPE) needed for
  travel is available before travel occurs.

All travel for conferences, related events and training do not meet this
requirement and are not authorized. Additional details regarding the new travel
threshold are included in
[this guidance](<https://insite.gsa.gov/cdnstatic/Updated%20Travel%20guidance%20%20(July%202021).pdf>).
