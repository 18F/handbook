Steps to take after onboarding:

- [Get access to Concur]({% page "/first-time-travel-get-in-concur" %})
- [Get reimbursed]({% page "/travel-and-leave/travel-and-leave-policies/travel-guide-4-reimbursement/" %})<br>

If you're traveling for TTS during your first two weeks (normally for
orientation, if you're based in a city that doesn't have a TTS office), you'll
need to follow special procedures to get your account set up, which will allow
you to make your flight and hotel reservations via AdTrav by calling (877)
472-6716. Here's what you need to do:

1. First thing to get is a **“travel vendor ID”**, which you can request by
   filling out
   [the EFT form](https://drive.google.com/a/gsa.gov/file/d/0B0Kck5dqF_Ebb0FFZ29RR0JmVVk/view?usp=sharing)
   and sending it to:
   [kc-vendor.number.requests@gsa.gov](mailto:kc-vendor.number.requests@gsa.gov).

   _Note if you haven't started and don't have your GSA email address yet_:

Your access to the EFT form linked above may be restricted, so you should have
received it as an attachment in your welcome email-- feel free to reach out to
[tts-travel@gsa.gov](mailto:tts-travel@gsa.gov) if you never got it. The EFT
form is needed so that the reimbursement for your hotels, meals, and other
expenses can be reimbursed (GSA only pays for your flight or Amtrak tickets
upfront).

2. Once you receive your travel vendor ID (should be in the format _E000xxxxx_),
   forward it to [tts-travel@gsa.gov](mailto:tts-travel@gsa.gov), along with
   your **Full Name** as it appears on ID and **Phone Number** as per TSA
   requirements.

3. **Book travel**: A member of the TTS travel team will reach out to you within
   two business days once you’ve sent in the above information, confirming that
   you've been set up in the Concur system. You may then call AdTrav at (877)
   472-6716 to make your reservations at your convenience.

   Email tts-travel@gsa.gov once you've finalized your reservations and they
   will approve your itinerary. Make sure this is done during business hours--
   no later than 3:30 PM ET!

Until you can [get a GSA travel
card]({% page "/first-time-travel-travel-card" %}), you will unfortunately have
to pay for your lodging and all other travel expenses other than air or rail
upfront. But with a valid receipt, you will get reimbursed (generally 6-10
business days after expenses are submitted). Just make sure to stay at a hotel
with rates under the government maximum (also known as the per diem rate).
[You can look up per diem rates here](https://www.gsa.gov/portal/category/100120).

4. **Receive tickets**: E-tickets will be sent to the email address that you
   provided. Once a reservation is made, you will get a “pending” itinerary,
   which will be finalized, depending on the airline, no later than 72 hours
   before departure.

5. **Travel!** Be sure to keep your receipts. [Read more about

   cancelled_]({% page "/travel-and-leave/travel-and-leave-policies/first-time-travel-get-in-concur-pre-olu/#what-happens-if-my-flight-gets-cancelled" %})

6. After you return, **create a voucher for reimbursement**:

   You can apply to be reimbursed for your travel expenses as soon as your
   return from your trip and have full access to Concur. Once you have completed
   the IT Security Awareness and Privacy Act trainings in
   [GSA's Online University (OLU)](https://gsaolu.gsa.gov/), you can apply for
   access to Concur by completing the
   [CGE Access Request Form](https://www.gsa.gov/forms-library/concur-government-edition-cge-access-request)
   and sending it to [tts-travel@gsa.gov](mailto:tts-travel@gsa.gov).

   Once you get access, you can follow [these instructions for how to complete a
   voucher]({% page "/travel-and-leave/travel-and-leave-policies/travel-guide-4-reimbursement/" %}). Feel free to
   [book travel office hours here](https://sites.google.com/a/gsa.gov/tts-office-hours/)
   any time should you need any assistance.

### What happens if my flight gets cancelled?

The easiest option is to have your airline reschedule you. If that's not
possible or timely, you may also call Ad-Trav at _(877) 472-6716_ to be rebooked
on any airline.

If you are traveling to orientation and are worried that you will miss it
because of delays or cancellations, please email the
[TTS Talent team](mailto:tts-jointts@gsa.gov) and copy anyone who helped you set
up travel. We will make arrangements for you to swear in when you expect to
arrive. You may have to attend GSA orientation in your home city 2 weeks later,
but please continue to travel to the office where your orientation was scheduled
to be for onboarding.

While the Talent and Travel Teams won't be available until Monday if your
cancellation occurs over the weekend, please feel comfortable rebooking your
travel either though the airline or via Ad-Trav, and rest assured that you will
be in good hands when you arrive at TTS.
