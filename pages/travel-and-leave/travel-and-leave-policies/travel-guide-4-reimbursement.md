## Brief overview of vouchers

You may be reimbursed for your expenses from official travel, or any other
approved expense paid for via personal funds (such as reimbursement for [local
travel]({% page "/travel-and-leave/travel-and-leave-policies/travel-guide-faq/#how-do-i-create-a-local-or-miscellaneous-voucher" %}),
or [professional liability
insurance]({% page "/travel-and-leave/travel-and-leave-policies/travel-guide-faq/#how-can-i-get-reimbursed-for-professional-liability-insurance" %})
for supervisors) by creating a voucher in [Concur](https://travel.gsa.gov).

You can get started by navigating to the **Vouchers** tab on top and selecting
**New Voucher**. If you do not yet have access to Concur, you can request it by
[following these steps]({% page "/first-time-travel-get-in-concur" %}).

BEFORE YOU BEGIN: _did your dates of travel change such that they are in any way
outside of the original dates of your trip? If yes, STOP, and create an [amended
authorization]({% page "/travel-guide-a-amended-authorizations" %}) for the new
dates._

- Any travel that involves a flight, Amtrak, or is otherwise over 12 hours in
  duration is considered a **[Voucher From
  Authorization]({% page "/travel-and-leave/travel-and-leave-policies/travel-guide-faq/#how-do-i-create-a-voucher-from-authorization" %})**.
- For any local travel choose the **[Local
  voucher]({% page "/travel-and-leave/travel-and-leave-policies/travel-guide-faq/#how-do-i-create-a-local-or-miscellaneous-voucher" %})**
  option. Ensure that [an email from your authorizing
  official]({% page "/travel-and-leave/travel-and-leave-policies/travel-guide-faq/#how-to-secure-authorizing-official-approval" %})
  approving the expenses you intend to get reimbursed has been sent to
  tts-travelauths@gsa.gov.
- For any other reimbursement, like expenses unrelated to travel such as
  professional liability insurance or training materials, choose the
  **[Miscellaneous
  voucher]({% page "/travel-and-leave/travel-and-leave-policies/travel-guide-faq/#how-do-i-create-a-local-or-miscellaneous-voucher" %})**
  option.

Once the voucher is created, the next step is to enter and edit expenses in the
**Expenses and Receipts** tab of the voucher. [Find out how to add, edit, and
delete
expenses]({% page "/travel-and-leave/travel-and-leave-policies/travel-guide-faq/#how-to-add-edit-or-delete-expenses" %})

Different types of expenses have different requirements. Some can be claimed
without further action needed, while others require receipts and/or a brief
justification. [Review requirements for different types of
expenses]({% page "/travel-and-leave/travel-and-leave-policies/travel-guide-faq/#when-are-receipts-or-further-justifications-required-to-claim-expenses" %}).

Finally, don't forget to [stamp and submit for travel team
approval!]({% page "/travel-and-leave/travel-and-leave-policies/travel-guide-faq/#how-to-stamp-and-submit-for-travel-team-approval" %})
Your voucher will be reviewed in 3-5 business days, and reimbursement will be
credited to your bank account and travel card 3-5 business days after approval.
