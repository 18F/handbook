There are four required steps to gain access to
[Concur](https://travel.gsa.gov/). Please be aware, you cannot access the
Cybersecurity & Privacy Training in OLU until after you are set up in HRLinks,
which can take up to a week. If immediate travel is required,
[tts-travel@gsa.gov](mailto:tts-travel@gsa.gov) can assist until your account is
active.

### 1. Get a travel vendor ID

To access [Concur](https://travel.gsa.gov/), you will need a **“travel vendor
ID”**. Use the
[Vendor Request Management site](https://finance.ocfo.gsa.gov/VendorRequest/co/Stepd.aspx)
to request a new vendor ID. (Note: The "travel vendor ID" will show up as "Employee ID" in
your Concur profile once it's been issued.)

**Vendor Request Instructions**

_You may experience slow page loads of about 30–60 seconds. This is not likely
an issue with your internet._

- To get started, in the radio buttons under "Service Office", select
  "Traveler". Then, under "ADD VENDOR/ADDR CODE", click the "CLICK HERE" button.
- For Point of Contact / POC fields, enter the contact information for your
  supervisor.
- For "Service Division", select "FAS" since TTS is under FAS.
- If you are a remote worker, enter your home address into the "Remit Address" field.
- To find your region, check [this resource](https://www.gsa.gov/about-us/gsa-regions) from GSA.
- For banking details, add your personal banking information. This is how you will be reimbursed for travel. Some folks have been able to go the next page by entering just their bank name, routing number, and account number.
- Once you complete the form and submit, you might see an error like
  `Application error occurred while saving the information to the database: Error getting next Request ID from database - Connect Timeout expired.`
  If this occurs, continue submitting until you receive a successful
  confirmation message.

If the travel finance team is unable to locate your payroll banking information,
they may request that you complete [the EFT form]({% download "downloads/EFT_Enrollment_Form.pdf" %}) and will provide
instructions on how you can send this information to them securely.

While you wait for the ID number to be generated and sent to you via email
(which can take up to 1 business day), you can get started on [applying for the
GSA travel card]({% page "/first-time-travel-travel-card" %}).

### 2. Completed Required Training in Online University (OLU)

Ensure you have completed the mandatory security and privacy training required
of all GSA staff, assigned to you in [OLU](https://insite.gsa.gov/#:~:text=IT%20Support%20Request-,Online%20University,-Pegasys). [Follow the instructions]({% page "/training-and-development/olu/#help-with-olu" %})
if you need help. Please ensure you have completed this year's Travel Card Training course in OLU. After completion, save a pdf copy of your certificate. Designated Travel Reviewers and Approvers must also complete the Temporary Duty Travel (TDY) Training course in OLU. Both training must be retaken every year.

### 3. Complete the CGE Access Request Form

Complete the [CGE Access Request Form][cgeform], minus the EFT enrollment form.
Either an electronic or ink signature is fine. Don't forget to get your
supervisor's signature as well! \*_Not sure about a particular field? Get help
by reading the_ _[FAQ below](#frequently-asked-questions)_

### 4. Email Completed Form(s) and Certificates(s) to TTS Travel (OLU)

Standard Travelers: Please email the completed CGE Form and Travel Card Training Certificate to tts-travel@gsa.gov. 

Travel Reviewers and Approvers: Please email the completed CGE Form, Travel Card Training Certificate and TDY Training Certificate to tts-travel@gsa.gov.

Do not email your request to cge-access-requests@gsa.gov, as the form specifies. Only email request to tts-travel@gsa.gov.

Please allow 10 business days for your account setup. You will receive a welcome email when your account is active.
