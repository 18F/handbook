There are four required steps to gain access to
[Concur](https://travel.gsa.gov/). Please be aware, you cannot access the
Cybersecurity & Privacy Training in OLU until after you are set up in HRLinks,
which can take up to a week. If immediate travel is required,
[tts-travel@gsa.gov](mailto:tts-travel@gsa.gov) can assist until your account is
active.

1. To access [Concur](https://travel.gsa.gov/), you will need a **“travel vendor
   ID”**. Use the
   [Vendor Request Management site](https://finance.ocfo.gsa.gov/VendorRequest/co/Stepd.aspx)
   to request a new vendor ID. Please note that you'll need to be on the VPN to
   access this site. (Note: The "travel vendor ID" will show up as "Employee ID" in your Concur profile once it's been issued.)

**Vendor Request Instructions**

*You may experience slow page loads of about 30–60 seconds. This is not likely
an issue with your internet.*

* To get started, in the radio buttons under "Service Office", select
  "Traveler". Then, under "ADD VENDOR/ADDR CODE", click the "CLICK HERE" button.
* For Point of Contact / POC fields, enter the contact information for your
  supervisor.
* For "Service Division", select "FAS" since TTS is under FAS.
* Once you complete the form and submit, you might see an error like
  `Application error occurred while saving the information to the database: Error getting next Request ID from database - Connect Timeout expired.`
  If this occurs, continue submitting until you receive a successful
  confirmation message.

In case the travel finance team is unable to locate your payroll banking
information, they may request that you complete
[the EFT form](https://drive.google.com/a/gsa.gov/file/d/0B0Kck5dqF_Ebb0FFZ29RR0JmVVk/view?usp=sharing)
and will provide instructions on how you can send this information to them
securely.

While you wait for the ID number to be generated and sent to you via email
(which can take up to 1 business day), you may get started on \[applying for the
GSA travel card]({% page "/first-time-travel-travel-card" %}).

2. Ensure you have completed the mandatory security and privacy training
   required of all GSA staff, assigned to you in OLU (https://gsaolu.gsa.gov).
   Follow the instructions
   \[here]({% page "/training-and-development/olu/#help-with-olu" %}) if you need
   help.
3. Complete the
   [CGE Access Request Form](https://www.gsa.gov/forms-library/concur-government-edition-cge-access-request),
   minus the EFT enrollment form. Either an electronic or ink signature is fine.
   Don't forget to get your supervisor's signature as well! **Not sure about a
   particular field? Get help by reading the*
   *[FAQ below](#frequently-asked-questions)*
4. Email completed CGE form to [tts-travel@gsa.gov](mailto:tts-travel@gsa.gov).
   *Do not email it to cge-access-requests@gsa.gov,* as the form specifies. Only
   email it to tts-travel@gsa.gov. Your account will be set up before
   [the next travel office hours](https://sites.google.com/a/gsa.gov/tts-office-hours/),
   which you can also book any time if you have questions.
