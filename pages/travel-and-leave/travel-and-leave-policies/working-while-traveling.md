When you're working from an atypical location in another time zone or attending
a conference, it is helpful to communicate your location so people know what to
expect in terms of timezone and availability. Consider:

- Noting your location in your Slack name and/or status (for example:
  `Jane Doe | WFBoston | she`).
- If you're in a full-day event or otherwise expect not to be available, mark
  that time on your calendar and make a note of it in your Slack name and/or
  status.
- [Optional] Some folks also create a multi-day event on their calendars to note
  where they are (for example, a five-day event called "Working from Boston").
  This helps your colleagues understand when to expect a response and avoids
  confusion.
