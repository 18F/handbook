## Note about travel to a training, conference, speaking event, large team IRL, or international

Authorizing official approval is secured via the [event request
process]({% page "/conferences-events-training" %}), so you are all set as long
as your travel is booked in Concur and is in SUBMIT TO APPROVER status. <br>
<br> _However, an email of approval is still required if you will be [extending
your trip at your own
expense]({% page "/travel-and-leave/travel-and-leave-policies/travel-guide-faq/#what-if-i-am-extending-travel-for-personal-reasons" %}),
[flying to or from points that are not either your duty station or location of
the
event]({% page "/travel-and-leave/travel-and-leave-policies/travel-guide-faq/#what-if-i-am-returning-to-or-traveling-from-a-location-other-than-home" %}),
or combining your event travel with travel for some other reason._
