## Brief overview of booking travel

If you have been [set up in
Concur]({% page "/first-time-travel-get-in-concur" %}), received your [GSA
travel card]({% page "/first-time-travel-travel-card" %}), [saved your travel
card information to your Concur
profile]({% page "/first-time-travel-complete-concur-profile" %}), and have
started the process of [securing approval from your authorizing
official]({% page "/travel-and-leave/travel-and-leave-policies/travel-guide-faq/#how-to-secure-authorizing-official-approval" %})
(you may also book first to get the most accurate estimate of costs for either
the [email of
approval]({% page "/travel-and-leave/travel-and-leave-policies/travel-guide-faq/#how-to-secure-authorizing-official-approval" %})
or [event request when
applicable]({% page "/travel-and-leave/travel-and-leave-policies/travel-guide-faq/#how-can-i-get-my-travel-approved-to-attend-a-training-conference-speaking-event-or-other-irl-or-large-team-gathering" %})),
head into **[Concur](https://travel.gsa.gov)**, where you can book:

- [Flights or
  Amtrak]({% page "/travel-and-leave/travel-and-leave-policies/travel-guide-faq/#how-to-book-flights-or-rail" %}),
  paid directly by GSA
- [Hotels]({% page "/travel-and-leave/travel-and-leave-policies/travel-guide-faq/#book-lodging" %}),
  charged to your GSA travel card
- [Rental
  cars]({% page "/travel-and-leave/travel-and-leave-policies/travel-guide-faq/#booking-a-rental-car" %})
  (if approved), charged to your GSA travel card

Any reservations made in Concur will be held until approvals are secured and
finalized-- nothing is charged to you, your travel card, or GSA.

**Note:** _If you don't have your GSA travel card yet OR your estimated
departure is less than 72 hours away, call AdTrav at (877) 472-6716 to make your
reservations, then [head into Concur an hour later](https://travel.gsa.gov)._
**Make sure you continue to follow the steps below, or your travel will not be
ticketed!**

_If you don't yet have a travel card and book through AdTrav, hotels will be
charged against a personal credit or debit card, but flights or rail will be
charged directly to the GSA._

## Brief overview of finalizing approvals

Once you have finalized your reservations, there are still a few more steps to
follow through on.

- [Completing trip
  information]({% page "/travel-and-leave/travel-and-leave-policies/travel-guide-faq/#how-to-complete-your-trip-information" %}),
  including relevant details about your trip.
- [Justify any rental car use or personal vehicle mileage
  claims]({% page "/travel-and-leave/travel-and-leave-policies/travel-guide-faq/#how-to-justify-rental-cars-and-personal-vehicle-mileage" %}),
  when applicable.
- [Stamp and submit
  authorization]({% page "/travel-and-leave/travel-and-leave-policies/travel-guide-faq/#how-to-stamp-and-submit-for-travel-team-approval" %}),
  ensuring your authorization is in SUBMIT TO APPROVER status.
- If you haven't done so already, [secure written approval from your authorizing
  official]({% page "/travel-and-leave/travel-and-leave-policies/travel-guide-faq/#how-to-secure-authorizing-official-approval" %})
  and send it to tts-travelauths@gsa.gov so the TTS travel team can likewise
  approve your trip in the system.

Ensure all of the above steps are completed no later than 3:30 PM ET the last
business day before travel to give the travel team sufficient time to review.
After-hours or emergency travel requests may be made in coordination with your
supervisor and AdTrav via the process outlined
[here]({% page "/travel-guide-b-after-hours-emergency-travel-authorizations" %}).<br>
<br> Should you need to rebook your travel at any point in the process, read the
instructions [here]({% page "/travel-guide-a-amended-authorizations" %}).
