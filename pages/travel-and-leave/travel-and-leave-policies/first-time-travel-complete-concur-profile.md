You will want to complete your Concur profile to pay for hotels listed in Concur
with your Travel Card and get your preferred airline seats, miles, rewards, etc.

**Please take time to review this step if you haven’t traveled in a while.**

It will make booking hotels in Concur easier, and allow you to personally redeem
miles and/or points earned while on government travel.

1. Log into Concur [travel.gsa.gov](https://travel.gsa.gov/).

   - If you have trouble logging into Concur, try connecting to the
     [GSA VPN]({{site.base_url}}/tools/anyconnect/) or
     [virtual desktop]({{site.base_url}}/getting-started/how-to-log-in/#citrix-virtual-desktop-client-login)
     first. Concur does work off VPN, but some users have had to go through the
     password reset process for access.

2. In the _I want to..._ menu select **Edit my profile**
3. Update your **Your Information > Personal Information**
4. If you have already received your card in the mail, add your GSA Credit card
   to **Your Information > Credit Cards**. **If you skipped this step because
   you had to travel before getting a Travel Card, return to it when your card
   arrives.** You’ll be glad you did.
5. _Optional_ Update your **Travel Settings > Travel Preferences** Do you prefer
   window seats? Have a frequent flyer or hotel points account? You get to keep
   those, yay!
