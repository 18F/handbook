You will want to complete your Concur profile to pay for hotels listed in Concur
with your Travel Card and get your preferred airline seats, miles, rewards, etc.

**Please take time to review this step if you haven’t traveled in a while.**

It will make booking hotels in Concur easier, and allow you to personally redeem
miles and/or points earned while on government travel.

1. Log into Concur [travel.gsa.gov](https://travel.gsa.gov/).
2. Open the profile menu by clicking on the dropdown menu in the top right corner and select **Profile Settings**
3. On the **Profile Options** page, select **Personal Information** to update if needed.
4. If you have already received your card in the mail, add your GSA Credit card
   to **Your Information > Credit Cards** from the sidebar or **Profile Options** page. **If you skipped this step because
   you had to travel before getting a Travel Card, return to it when your card
   arrives.** You’ll be glad you did.
5. _Optional_ Update your **Travel Settings > Travel Preferences** Do you prefer
   window seats? Have a frequent flyer or hotel points account? You get to keep
   those, yay!

Note: each time you save you'll get thrown back to the **Profile Options** page and will receive an email that your profile has been updated. You can avoid this by editing each section as needed and clicking save once. Every individual section has a save button so feel free to click any of them (they all appear to work).
