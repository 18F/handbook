This Handbook page provides a brief overview of overtime, comp time, and credit
hours.

There are several factors which affect how you could be compensated for working
extra hours. One is your salary: if your salary is at - or close to - the
maximum GS salary ($176,300 in FY22). Another factor is whether you are an
[exempt or non-exempt employee](https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/WHD/legacy/files/fs17a_overview.pdf).

You should obtain supervisor approval prior to working extra hours. And, your
supervisor should understand your specific situation prior to approving
overtime.

The guidance below is only a high level overview. You and/or your supervisor can
reach out to PeopleOps anytime with questions about your specific situation.

## Overtime and Comp Time

Overtime and comp time can be approved by your supervisor no matter what type of
[work schedule]({% page "/general-information-and-resources/employee-resources-policies/work-schedules" %})
you have.

Overtime is when you are paid for extra hours that you work, whereas comp time
is when you receive hours of leave instead of pay.

You should use your accrued comp time before using Annual Leave. However, if the
end of the leave year is approaching, your supervisor can approve your Annual
Leave requests first if you are in danger of losing Annual Leave because of
“[Use or Lose]({% page "/travel-and-leave/leave/#annual-leave" %}).”

Comp time expires one year (26 pay periods) after it is earned. When you reach
the expiration date, what happens depends on whether you are an
[exempt or non-exempt employee](https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/WHD/legacy/files/fs17a_overview.pdf):

- If you are exempt: you will forfeit the leave.
- If you are non-exempt: you will be paid out the hours (at the overtime pay
  rate that was in effect when you earned the hours).

If you leave GSA, your comp time will follow the parameters above: either
forfeited or paid out, depending on your exemption status.

## Credit Hours

Note: Credit hours are only available if you are on a
[flexible work schedule]({% page "/general-information-and-resources/employee-resources-policies/work-schedules/#flexible-schedule" %}).

You can be approved for credit hours if you want to voluntarily work additional
hours to your normal/approved schedule. If you are required to work additional
hours, you will receive overtime or comp time.

- You can have up to 24 credit hours accrued, at any given time.
- The hours will rollover from one pay period to the next, and they never
  expire.
- Credit hours cannot be converted to cash, unless you leave GSA (then they will
  be paid out).

### Credit hours example

You are on a
[Gliding schedule]({% page "/general-information-and-resources/employee-resources-policies/work-schedules/#gliding" %}),
and you work 8 hours every day. You are not required to stay late, but you are
in a productive headspace and want to work an extra hour to finish your project.
You can talk to your supervisor and ask to work 1 more hour, therefore receiving
1 credit hour. You will need to request the 1 hour in HR Links, and your
supervisor will need to approve it.

## Religious comp time
You can request an adjustment to your work schedule for religious observances, instead of taking leave. Document your request to your supervisor, via email, in advance of the time you’ll need to miss, along with the schedule of the time you will work outside of normal hours to compensate.

Note: religious comp time does not follow the salary cap rules that are outlined in the beginning of this document. Anyone can request religious comp time, regardless of their salary and what type of work schedule they are on.

## Travel comp time
When you travel in connection to TTS, the time you spend traveling may be regular time, overtime, or travel comp time, depending on when the travel occurs. 

You’ll complete overtime and comp time requests after you travel because you may encounter delays. Keep a copy of your travel itinerary to help you remember your trip.

Refer to the [Compensation for Government Travel slidedeck](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RFSq_4KdMza_pkcHGp9Hy2RNR2ryLs0b/view?usp=sharing) to determine the breakdown of your hours.

Note: travel comp time does not follow the salary cap rules that are outlined in the beginning of this document. Anyone can request religious comp time, regardless of their salary and what type of work schedule they are on.


## Entering the overtime, comp time, and/or credit hours you will be working into HRLinks

Entering your hours is a two step process.

### Step 1 - Submit a time request in HRLinks
You need to enter your overtime, comp time, or credit hours into HRLinks. Your supervisor will be notified to approve the hours.

- Click on the **Employee Time Requests** tile
- Select **Additional Time Requests**
- Click time request type: **Comp Time Earned**, **Credit Hours Earned**, **Overtime Request**, **Religious Comp Earned**, or **Travel Comp Time Earned**
  - For **Overtime**, you will need to select a reason you worked overtime. 
- Select **Additional Time Type**
- Enter **Start Date** and **End Date**
- Enter **Requested Hours**
- Enter **Comments**
- Click **Submit**

You’ll receive emails after submitting the request, and after it is approved. There is a [step-by-step guide to submitting time requests](https://corporateapps.gsa.gov/files/Request-Overtime_Comp-Time_Credit-Hours.pdf).

### Step 2 - Update your timesheet
Currently, HR Links is not connecting Comp/Credit/Overtime hours to your timesheet. This means you will need to manually add the hours you earned to your timesheet on the day(s) when you earned them. You’ll do this after your supervisor has approved the hours in step 1. 

There is a [step-by-step guide on adding the hours to your timesheet](https://corporateapps.gsa.gov/files/Add-Overtime_Comp-Time_Credit-Hours-to-Timesheet.pdf). Reach out to {% slack_channel "people-ops" %} if you need assistance.

## Using the comp time and/or credit hours you’ve earned

You will submit a [leave
request]({% page "/travel-and-leave/leave/#entering-a-leave-request" %}), just
like you do for other types of leave. When searching in HR Links for the leave
type to request, the codes and leave names are:

- `041 - Comp Time Used`
- `037 - Credit Hours Used`
- `047 - Religious Comp Time Used`
- `043 - Travel Comp Time Used`
