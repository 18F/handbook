You will need supervisor approval before working extra hours. Generally, do not expect to work extra hours unless you’re working on a high-profile project.

You will need to [manually request these hours in HR Links]({% page "/tools/hrlinks/#entering-the-extra-hours-you-will-be-working-2" %}) before [using them]({% page "/tools/hrlinks/#using-the-hours-you-ve-earned-2" %}). 

## Overtime and Compensatory (Comp) time

Your ability to use these options depends on your [salary level](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/salaries-wages/) and [work schedule]({% page "/general-information-and-resources/employee-resources-policies/work-schedules/" %}):

* The amount of overtime or comp time you can receive depends on your salary level. Refer to the [Bi-weekly Comp Time Cap Calculator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q7wVWPWzBYljj87Wzl-ouVDJux9vplOP_zg3ryxz0iw/edit#gid=0) to see how much comp time you can earn.  
* If you make the maximum salary ($191,900 in 2024), you cannot receive overtime or comp time. You can only be compensated with credit hours on a flexible schedule.

### Overtime, depending on your salary level

Overtime is when you are paid for extra hours that you are required to work. The amount of overtime pay you receive depends on your GS- level and [FLSA exemption status]({% page "/tools/hrlinks/#flsa-exemption-status-2" %}).

Your total pay (including overtime) cannot exceed the maximum salary at GSA, which is $191,900 as of 2024. This is GS-15, step 10, including any applicable special salary rate or locality rate of pay.

Refer to OPM’s [Overtime Fact Sheet](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/pay-administration/fact-sheets/overtime-pay-title-5/) for more detail.

### Compensatory (Comp) time, depending on your salary level

Comp time is when you receive hours of leave instead of overtime pay. To determine the maximum number of comp time hours that you can accrue per pay period, please use the [Bi-weekly Comp Time Cap Calculator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q7wVWPWzBYljj87Wzl-ouVDJux9vplOP_zg3ryxz0iw/edit#gid=0). If you make the maximum salary ($191,900 in 2024), you cannot receive comp time.

You should use your accrued comp time before using Annual Leave. However, if the end of the leave year is approaching, your supervisor can approve your Annual Leave requests first if you are in danger of losing Annual Leave because of “[Use or Lose](https://handbook.tts.gsa.gov/travel-and-leave/leave/#annual-leave).”

Comp time expires one year (26 pay periods) after it is earned. When you reach the expiration date, you will forfeit the leave. If you leave GSA, your comp time will be paid out.

Refer to OPM’s [Comp Time Fact Sheet](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/pay-administration/fact-sheets/compensatory-time-off/) for more detail.

## Credit hours, in flexible work schedules

Only people on [flexible work schedules](https://handbook.tts.gsa.gov/general-information-and-resources/employee-resources-policies/work-schedules/#flexible-schedule-2) can earn and use credit hours. There is no salary maximum for earning and using credit hours.

You can be approved for credit hours if you want to voluntarily work additional hours to your normal/approved schedule. If you are required to work additional hours, you will receive overtime or comp time.

* You can have up to 24 credit hours accrued, at any given time.

* The hours will rollover from one pay period to the next, and they never expire.

* Credit hours cannot be converted to cash, unless you leave GSA (then they will be paid out).

Refer to OPM’s [Credit Hours Fact Sheet](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/work-schedules/fact-sheets/credit-hours-under-a-flexible-work-schedule/) for more detail.

### Credit hours example

You are on a [Gliding schedule](https://handbook.tts.gsa.gov/general-information-and-resources/employee-resources-policies/work-schedules/#gliding), and you work 8 hours every day. You are not required to stay late, but if you are in a productive headspace and want to work an extra hour to finish work, you can ask your supervisor about working 1 more hour, therefore receiving 1 credit hour. You will need to request the 1 hour in HR Links, and your supervisor will need to approve it.

## Religious comp time, for everyone

[Per OPM guidance](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/work-schedules/fact-sheets/adjustment-of-work-schedules-for-religious-observances/), you can request an adjustment to your work schedule for religious observances, instead of using annual leave. In HR Links, this is treated as another kind of comp time.

Email your supervisor about the extra hours you plan to work before a religious observance. 

## Travel comp time, for everyone

You may request travel comp time when you are approved to travel for work and the travel occurs outside regular working hours. Travel comp time is for “temporary duty” aka “TDY” travel, *not* local travel or commuting. TDY travel is more than 12 hours long and requires a pre-approved authorization in Concur.

There are no limitations for earning travel comp time based on salary level or schedule type.

Refer to OPM’s [Travel Comp Time Fact Sheet](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/pay-administration/fact-sheets/compensatory-time-off-for-travel/) for more detail. Ask general questions in {% slack_channel "travel" %}.

### Understanding travel comp time

Traveling during your regular work hours is considered regular hours, including traveling to the airport from your home.

Generally, travel comp time is used as a “gap filler” when you are traveling outside of your regular work hours during a regular work day, but not officially “performing work.” 

For further details, refer to the [Compensation for Government Travel slidedeck](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RFSq_4KdMza_pkcHGp9Hy2RNR2ryLs0b/view?usp=sharing) to determine the breakdown of your hours. Please contact your Timekeeper or an HR Specialist at your agency if you have questions.

### Calculating travel comp time

For calculating travel comp time hours, travel ends when you check in at the hotel. Travel comp time hours are based on elapsed time. Use the time zone at departure to calculate elapsed time.

To accurately report travel time, we recommend keeping a log of:

* When you departed your home and arrived at the airport  
* When your flights actually departed and arrived  
* When you left the destination airport and arrived at your hotel

### Using travel comp time

Travel comp time expires one year (26 pay periods) after it is earned. When you reach the expiration date, you will forfeit the leave. If you leave GSA, any unused travel comp time will be forfeited.
