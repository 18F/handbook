## Background

The Tech Operations was formed in July 2019 as the reincarnation of the 18F/TTS
Infrastructure team. Our team assists TTS programs with their Infrastructure and Software needs. 
We are technically under the Acquisition Services Fund (ASF),
though our funding comes through overhead charged to TTS programs.

## Responsibilities

### Operational Support
Provides the critical tools, systems, and services that empower the TTS workforce to perform at the highest quality level. Our focus is on delivering seamless technology solutions that enhance productivity, collaboration, and operational efficiency across TTS.

### Strategic Planning and Advisory
Assist in identifying gaps or areas of opportunity within TTS’ technical landscape by recommending the best courses of action that aligns with organizational goals. This includes evaluating technology needs and exploring solutions that provide maximum value to TTS. 

### Collaboration with GSA IT
Serves as the primary liaison between TTS and GSA’s Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) to provide high levels of service, collaboration, and open communication. We help foster strong relationships between teams while balancing needs and expectations to find compromises when necessary.

### Security and Compliance Oversight
Responsible for developing, implementing, and/or enforcing technology-related policies that govern the use of systems, data access, and security across TTS. We work to ensure TTS operates efficiently while staying compliant and secure. 

### Cost and Resource Optimization
Plays a key role in evaluating how technology resources are utilized within TTS, seeking opportunities to reduce redundancy, eliminate inefficiencies, and avoid unnecessary duplication of efforts. We look for opportunities to consolidate and centralize services, offering enterprise-wide shared technology solutions where appropriate. 

### Continuous Improvement
Actively identify areas for continuous improvement strategies with TTS’ technological environment, from optimizing processes and systems to implement new technologies.
