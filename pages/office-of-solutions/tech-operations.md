## Division Overview
The goal of the Technology Operations (Tech Ops) Division is to provide security, compliance, infrastructure, and policy expertise to help procure, authorize, and manage TTS-wide hardware, software, and services. We work closely with various CIO organizations to ensure technologies used by TTS meet federal and GSA regulations.

We are a small team that manages TTS-wide IaaS/PaaS/SaaS contracts (i.e Airtable, Docker Desktop, New Relic, Zendesk, etc.). We perform the technical controls for FedRAMP Authorizations - like setting up SAML/Google Oauth, and user onboarding/offboarding. For IaaS, we manage all of the AWS/GCP/Azure access and account provisioning to include root account management, account creation, baseline configuration for all accounts (logging, password/MFA policies, Secureauth jump accounts, etc.) and user on/offboarding to our sandbox accounts. 

## Responsibilities

### Operational Support

### Strategic Planning and Advisory
Assist in identifying gaps or areas of opportunity within TTS’ technical landscape by recommending the best courses of action that aligns with organizational goals. This includes evaluating technology needs and exploring solutions that provide maximum value to TTS. 

### Collaboration with GSA IT
Serves as the primary liaison between TTS and GSA’s Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) to provide high levels of service, collaboration, and open communication. We help foster strong relationships between teams while balancing needs and expectations to find compromises when necessary.

### Security and Compliance Oversight
Responsible for developing, implementing, and/or enforcing technology-related policies that govern the use of systems, data access, and security across TTS. We work to ensure TTS operates efficiently while staying compliant and secure. 

### Cost and Resource Optimization
Plays a key role in evaluating how technology resources are utilized within TTS, seeking opportunities to reduce redundancy, eliminate inefficiencies, and avoid unnecessary duplication of efforts. We look for opportunities to consolidate and centralize services, offering enterprise-wide shared technology solutions where appropriate. 

### Continuous Improvement
