**Mission:** We exist to make TTS more productive and secure, empowering our
staff and programs to better deliver on their missions.

**Vision:** We strive to make TTS the model for how to do IT in government:
human-centered, transparent, and as a force-multiplier for the organization(s)
we serve.

## Background

The Tech Operations was formed in July 2019 as the reincarnation of the 18F/TTS
Infrastructure team. Our team assists TTS programs with their Infrastructure and Software needs. 
We are technically under the Acquisition Services Fund (ASF),
though our funding comes through overhead charged to TTS programs.

## Responsibilities

We coordinate everything technology-related that is shared across multiple TTS programs,
particularly security, compliance, infrastructure, and policy. We provide all
the things that allow TTS staff to get their jobs done at the highest quality
level.

Rather than try to exert control over everything technology at TTS. 
The Tech Operationsâ€™s work applies to much more than technology; 
it applies to our entire operation, including how TTS
works inside the law, secures our systems, and spends money. We also:

- Find where we may be duplicating effort or have gaps around technology, and if
  those are opportunities for TTS/GSA/government-wide shared services
- Serve as the primary liaison between GSA IT and TTS, ensuring high levels of
  service, finding compromise, and generally keeping a good relationship between
  the teams

**Take a look at the following for more specifics:**

- [Our roles](https://github.com/gsa-tts/tts-tech-operations/blob/main/how_we_work/roles.md#readme)

### Out of scope

The following are example tasks that TTS Tech Operations isn't responsible for in
its current state:

- Purchasing office equipment for individuals (rather than the project the
  individual supports)
- Picking up software development tasks for TTS programs
- Being the owners/stewards/pushers of data/metrics for TTS, beyond what applies
  to responsibilities listed above
