## Background

The Tech Operations was formed in July 2019 as the reincarnation of the 18F/TTS
Infrastructure team. Our team assists TTS programs with their Infrastructure and Software needs. 
We are technically under the Acquisition Services Fund (ASF),
though our funding comes through overhead charged to TTS programs.

**Mission:** Leverage innovative technologies to provide TTS users with seamless support by maximizing productivity, efficiency, and reliable access to data & systems while maintaining a secure, robust technology environment that drives continuous improvement, optimal performance, and user satisfaction across all operational aspects. 

**Vision:**  We strive to be a driving force behind organizational success by creating a future where technology empowers TTS users to work smarter, faster, and more securely. 

**Division Overview:**  Tech Ops provides security, compliance, infrastructure, and policy expertise to help procure, authorize, and manage TTS-wide hardware, software, and services. We work closely with various CIO organizations to confirm technologies used by TTS meet federal and GSA policies and regulations.
