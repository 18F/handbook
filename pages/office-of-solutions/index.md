Welcome to SOL’s team page!

## Our Mission and Purpose

Our mission is to help the public use and understand government, and help
agencies understand and serve the public. To achieve this, we create, discover,
connect and share practical solutions and products that transform government.

## Our Values

- We engage agencies where they are as trusted partners; understanding their
  constraints and helping them adapt to changing public expectations.
- We work government-wide, unconstrained by a single agency mission. This lets
  us innovate across agency boundaries to help deliver a coherent experience to
  the public.
- We learn directly from the public about their challenges in getting government
  information. And using technology and innovative ideas, we help agencies
  embrace those challenges.

## What We Do

We offer cross-government products and programs that help agencies deliver
modern services to the public. And we maintain the front door to the federal
government via USA.gov, USA.gov en Español, and the USAGov Contact Center.
