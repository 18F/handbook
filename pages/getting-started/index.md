There's a rule of thumb that says it takes at least three months to understand a
new job, and that
[your first 90 days](https://randsinrepose.com/archives/ninety-days/) are are
crucial to understanding just what the heck you're supposed to be doing.

That's probably never more true than when you're working for the federal
government, where regulations and [acronyms]({% page "/glossary/" %}) can
quickly become overwhelming. Working here is a lot like learning a language via
immersion: the first weeks are likely to be spent trying to thumb through your
handbook quickly enough to communicate at all. This can be very frustrating,
even for new employees who have worked at other federal agencies!

To help you get past that frustration and contributing as quickly as possible,
we try to cover all the bases in [your TTS Classes for
Onboarding]({% page "/getting-started/classes/" %}). But we also recognize those
are a firehose of information and a lot of stuff won't make much sense right
now.

So, here's a guide to help you focus your onboarding efforts and work through
some technical tasks that set everyone at TTS up for success. You don't need to
know all of this stuff today. Skim it now, then refer back to it over your first
90 days or so as you're ready to absorb more. Pretty soon you'll be the veteran
around here, helping someone else learn these things.

## Getting started

Within your first week or two you should be working through your onboarding
checklist, [TTS Classes for Onboarding]({% page "/getting-started/classes/" %})
and any [OLU training](https://gsaolu.gsa.gov) that's been assigned. If you're
not, go take a look at those first.

As you try to understand [TTS and what it's about]({% page "/tts-history/" %}),
you may want to take a look at these org charts:

- [TTS organizational chart](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1yXywmOStNyqx1RdFpkdyl32WY8TmHyQwPFUJSkf1WJc/edit?usp=sharing)
- [Solutions org chart](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ZwGf43skvRo-ZkY4i9jLMDZXWtqarHqtfWsNClku7n8/edit?usp=sharing)
- [Login org chart](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiTR2ohdl0NIsrF4gJjNipEZ0z0oq1pOFWYjHg8Tbi0/edit?usp=sharing)
- [18F org chart](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/189TanLPSFF9MWvNr6VdfUvhBAWBSXeoCSGD2ZXRDm3s/edit?ts=5c8b93f9#slide=id.g54b7f7db38_18_0)

You'll probably spend quite a bit of time with [the TTS
Handbook]({% page "/" %}) --- you're reading it now! The TTS Handbook isn't at
all like most organizational handbooks. Where past experience might have you
expecting a dry rehashing of PR policies and jargon-heavy mission statements,
we've filled our Handbook with useful information that we update regularly ---
and you can help update it, too. Get in there, poke around, and search a little.
It's a treasure trove.

Here's a tip: As you work through your onboarding checklist, search the handbook
for the items in your list. You'll find tons of extra information and context.

Don't underestimate how helpful your teammates will be, either. Talk to them -
in Slack, in Google Hangouts, or in person, if you are based in one of our
offices. Set up coffees --- just say "Coffee me" in a Slack channel that has our
bot [Charlie](http://github.com/18f/charlie) in it (or in a DM to Charlie) and
you will be paired up with someone. Don't hesitate to reach out for coffee with
someone outside of your area, either. Everyone here is positively brimming with
useful information to share.

Remember, this is learning-by-immersion, so as you get invited to things, say
"yes" a lot. Say yes to all the video meetings and [guilds and working
groups]({% page "/working-groups-and-guilds-101/" %}) to which you are invited.
Listen and ask questions. Tell us if you think we're doing things wrong. Tell us
about your pets. Just get in there and get actively involved. You can always say
"no" later, but right now you can learn a lot by just saying yes.

You don't need to have any specific expertise to join a guild or working group:
just join their Slack channel and start attending their standing meetings. If
you need an invite, post a message in the Slack channel or DM whoever organizes
the group (who's often listed in a pinned post in that Slack channel).

If you need support, can't find it here in the Handbook, and don't know where to
start, {% slack_channel "questions" %} is a good Slack channel to drop into if
you think multiple people could direct you. But you can absolutely turn to your
supervisor and/or lead/functional lead. For 18F folks, there's a bit more detail
over here in
[Support]({% page "/18f/projects-partners/leading-projects/#how-do-project-leads-and-team-members-get-support" %}),
much of which may also apply to other parts of TTS.

## Technical considerations

TTS is a technical organization, so even if you're not an engineer you will find
yourself in technical environments. Here are the bits everyone will probably
need to know:

### GitHub and Version control

Version control is simply the act of keeping track of a file without having to
name it "myfile-10-10-18-final-final-final-approved." Instead of creating a new
version of a file for each change, you use a system to keep track of revisions.
This is especially important when you're talking about a whole bunch of files
working together, like code, or a large multi-page document. In that case, you
really need a version control system. Here at TTS, our version control system of
choice is GitHub.

Almost everyone at TTS spends some time working with GitHub, whether they're an
engineer or not. If this is new to you we suggest you start with our [Intro to
GitHub]({% page "/intro-to-github/" %}). When you're ready to begin using
GitHub, the [Handbook repository](https://github.com/18F/handbook) is a great
place to practice basics like creating a branch and a pull request. If you see
anything in the Handbook that appears out of date or incorrect, you can practice
your new pull request skills and help us improve it! You can also look through
the Handbook issues and fix something.

When you make the changes you want to see and open a pull request, someone will
review your code. Alternately, you may very well get pulled into a code review
someday because of your expertise in a topic.

If pull requests and code reviews feel a bit foreign to you, it might be helpful
to think of it as similar to suggesting changes in a shared Google Doc.Â  In both
cases, you're collaboratively trying to reach a final version.
[The TTS Engineering Practices Guide has some great guidance](https://engineering.18f.gov/code-review/#tips-for-a-successful-review)
on how to be a good code review partner, but the main thing to remember is
simply to be kind. We're all trying to improve things.

And remember: you can be fearless in your pull requests. If you ever manage to
break something in GitHub it can easily be changed back to how it was --- that's
the beauty of version control. If you get stuck, you can just wave in the
{% slack_channel "tts-handbook" %} Slack channel and someone will quickly help
you.

### Setting up your Mac for success

If you are running a project locally, you may find yourself needing to know
[some basics of the Mac OS X command line](https://blog.teamtreehouse.com/introduction-to-the-mac-os-x-command-line).

And remember, if you can't figure out how to get it running, that's probably not
your fault --- there is likely something that needs to be updated, and that can
be accomplished by reaching out in the {% slack_channel "dev" %}. Also you can
file an issue in the repository or contact one of the project owners or
contributors and ask them to update their README and any other relevant
documentation.

### Markdown

[Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) is probably the most
commonly used way to style text at TTS. It's used in GitHub, in Slack, and in
many other systems. If you see things that mostly look like plain text but have
some semi-random `*` and `#` littered through them, that's probably Markdown. It
was designed to mimic how one might write a text-only email.

There are quite a few online Markdown editors you can use, but after just a
little practice you won't need them. Pro tip: You can open a DM channel with
yourself in Slack and use most Markdown in messages to yourself to try it out
and see the results. Headers don't work in Slack, but most other Markdown
commands do. While you're DM-ing with yourself, you can also click the plus
button on the left side of the input box, click "Post", and practice your
Markdown in there. Slack's posts support more markdown than messages do, and it
renders live. Which is pretty neat.

### Security, Compliance, and ATOs

Security and compliance are, unsurprisingly, important issues for TTS. They're
also complex topics, and you'll find a lot of people working on them. For an
easy introduction into these topics, we suggest you start with
[this lightweight primer](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1vXZDhEONp-h-zmyCt9wpwscoANouVK4fg5br6Ynzlpk/edit#slide=id.g54fbd835cd_0_25),
especially if you haven't worked on information security before. Read the
["Security incidents" page]({% page "/security-incidents/" %}) to learn how to
respond if you spot suspicious activity or an incident. If you're looking to go
into greater detail, read the [Handbook section on launching
software]({% page "/#launching-software" %}). If you ever need a quick answer,
clarification or just general Security and Compliance help, reach out to the TTS
Tech Portfolio in {% slack_channel "tts-tech-portfolio channel" %}.

If you hear "ATO" or "Authority to Operate" and are wondering what that's about,
the [Handbook section on launching software]({% page "/#launching-software" %})
and the
{% slack_channel "g-security-compliance" "Security and Compliance Guild" %} can
help you out there, too.

You may also be wondering about security clearances. It's not something you need
to worry about now. If you're in 18F and staffed to a project that needs
clearance, your account manager and staffing rep should make sure that any
clearance needs are taken into account. Still, it's never a bad idea to ask if
you're wondering.

## TTS Products and Platforms

TTS offers many
[products and platforms](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vfBiQsprY1m8dG4tS_GeXkhG6ThF5ZqW9JKlDlvbWis/edit)
to federal agencies, and we are strong proponents of using those products and
platforms ourselves, too. Here are three TTS offerings that you will likely
interact with early on (and often) during your tenure here.

### Cloud.gov Pages (was Federalist)

It won't take long at TTS until you hear someone talking --- usually
emphatically and ecstatically --- about
[Cloud.gov Pages](https://cloud.gov/pages/), which is a really easy way to get a
.gov site up and running. If you're already familiar with static site
generators, then Pages will already be pretty clear to you. If you're not,
that's okay. It takes care of the hardest bits, and
[each step you need to take is well-documented](https://cloud.gov/pages/documentation/).
There's even
[a handy video to help you get started](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdhZz7udd1o).
If you ever get stuck, give a wave in {% slack_channel "federalist" %} or
{% slack_channel "federalist-support" %} and they'll get you back on track.

### Cloud.gov

Just as Federalist makes creating .gov sites as easy as possible,
[Cloud.gov ](https://cloud.gov/)makes hosting them as easy as possible, too, by
dealing with a bunch of security and compliance sticking points so you don't
have to. That convenience and trusted status means almost everything we build is
hosted on cloud.gov, including Federalist,
[cloud.gov is extensively documented](https://cloud.gov/docs/) and heavily
supported in {% slack_channel "cg-support" %}. Still not clear?
[They have a video, too](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCycNkxs-rE).

### USWDS

USWDS --- the
[United States Web Design System](https://designsystem.digital.gov/) --- is a
frontend framework designed to make it easy to build accessible, mobile-friendly
government websites. They've worked through hundreds of issues related to
accessibility, usability, and the overall user experience. Your project can
leverage that effort nearly instantly. To try out the USWDS on a test site, you
can use the
[templates provided by Pages](https://cloud.gov/pages/documentation/templates/).

Those are just three of the products TTS is working on, but
[there are many more](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vfBiQsprY1m8dG4tS_GeXkhG6ThF5ZqW9JKlDlvbWis/edit).

## Acquisitions and Procurement

18F alumni Sasha Magee memorably summed up the progression through government
digital service
[like this](https://twitter.com/sashax/status/941036458307076097):

- Year 1: "Why y'all talk about procurement so much? How boring."
- Year 2: "Man, procurement's a pain."
- Year 3: "We should really consider doing something about procurement"
- Year 4: "Holy crap there's nothing more important than solving procurement!"

You're going to hear a lot about acquisitions and procurement. For a quick dive,
[start with this simple introductory presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1FjJWwXrTbXexdTGeZKP6OjQ8i5B3GmOAj5MQTF_arLg/edit?disco=AAAADFGLhBo&ts=5cf90ee6&usp_dm=false#slide=id.g4eb21fd7af_0_178).
18F also gave a [great overview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-h6CtSwk30) to
the Michigan Senate Appropriation Committee back in February 2020. You may also
want to view these relevant decks presented during past 18F Team Coffees:

- [Pre-award management](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1uOuzFibFCvgW3I0XL54w2sKl7ObSBxk9cUlyTchJ8Gk/edit#slide=id.g57d5603040_0_23)

- [Post-award management](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1pBm3jTlkvPJyOX3KtbjZVcFkKrEwCyqJ9jdOXh0PPuA/edit#slide=id.g57d5603040_0_23)

After that, dive into the relevant handbook pages --- [this is a good starting
point]({% page "/working-on-an-acquisition-engagement/" %}) -- or ask any
questions you may have in {% slack_channel "acquisition" %}. If you want to go
really deep there are
[free courses available](https://www.fai.gov/training/find-and-register-for-courses)
from the Federal Acquisition Institute.

## Government budgeting

Government budgets have a big impact on what TTS works on and when. You may hear
terms like "one-year money" or "no-year money" or "the color of money" tossed
around and wonder what people are talking about. Here's
[a slide deck intro](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1UHCn895oezfhmAULtTaQZ3Yk2_yGU1eyInfQzmvh1Po/edit).

Most of TTS is funded from the
[Acquisition Services Fund](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/40/321)
(ASF). This fund does not receive annual appropriations from Congress, but
instead collects fees from the government agencies the fund serves. 18F, PIF,
and Centers of Excellence are "cost-recoverable," meaning that we must replace
the money we use from the ASF. So we take money from the fund to operate it,
then replenish it by charging our clients for our time.

Since the ASF is not subject to annual appropriations and has a sizeable
balance, 18F employees are typically allowed to continue to work and get paid in
the event of a government shutdown, although project work may be severely
limited.

OPP and 10x are the exceptions. They are funded from the Federal Citizen
Services Fund (FCSF), which means they get an annual appropriation from
Congress.

For more details on the federal budget process, government shutdowns, our
funding sources, and types of funding in agreements we enter, read
[All Things Money](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bnySzQ8xX3-Q7PHJUDysslwaggoXvDTMlUuRlnI8j0w/edit#).

### Billability

In order to recover costs, the ASF-funded offices need to bill their clients.
Because 18F rotates projects frequently, billing is ongoing and tracked through
Tock. Your project commitments should be captured by the
{% slack_channel "18f-staffing" %} team in the
[staffing GitHub repo](https://github.com/18f/staffing/issues).

Not everything 18F does is a billable project, and that's okay. Most people are
expected to average 4 days/week working toward project outcomes. Other time is
spent on things that aren't related to a partner or a project. This
"non-billable" work is often the glue that holds the organization together:
guilds, working groups, internal tools and documentation.

You can learn more about billing expectations and time tracking in the [Tock
Handbook pages]({% page "/tock/" %}).

## 18F projects

Almost all 18F projects are considered either a Path Analysis (PA) or an
Experiment and Iterate (E&I) engagement.
[You can learn more about both in the 18F "How We Work" guide](https://18f.gsa.gov/how-we-work/),
which you're going to want to read anyway.

The short version is that a PA is a short, exploratory engagement in which we
help the partner define the problem and look at some potential solutions. For
more information and resources, take a look in the
[Project Artifacts repo](https://github.com/18F/project-artifacts/blob/master/approach.md).

In a follow-up E&I engagement we, well, experiment and iterate on the findings
from the PA. For both types of engagements we have refined an ever-larger set of
reusable resources that you can learn more about in the
{% slack_channel "project-resources" %} Slack channel and
[18F Resources Library in AirTable](https://airtable.com/shrZDkbAFlqkpxY8G).

[Staffing projects at 18F](https://github.com/18F/staffing/blob/master/README.md)
might first appear intimidating, but there is
[a lot of thought behind it](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lm7WgfW2u7sMvgcmyxfmbh61cg21fBqvIvzBkXuGfZQ/edit).
And yes, we do apply agile thinking to everything, including staffing.

The short version is that projects are staffed through the
[18F Staffing repo](https://github.com/18F/staffing/issues), and you can always
comment on an issue to express your interest.

### Our approach to Agile

We are known for our Agile approach to both software development and procurement
(sometimes called âmodular procurementâ). In fact, many of our partners come to
us because they want to learn how to âbe more Agile.â If you take away nothing
else from this page, take this:

> Agile is not something you _do_. Agile is something you _are_.

Of course there are many ways to âbe Agile,â and everyone at 18F will have their
own take. This is great, and we encourage healthy debate about Agile best
practices. In order to ensure a consistent experience for our partners, we do
ask everyone to adhere to these basic principles:

- Don't worry too much about buzzwords like âSAFeâ or âLeanâ or âScrumâ or
  âKanban.â Itâs more important that we adhere to the spirit of Agile, meaning
  that we employ
  [iterative and incremental development](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/agile-needs-to-be-both-iterative-and-incremental),
  we make small bets to decrease risk, we seek to learn as we go, and we pivot
  when necessary.
- A corollary to the above: Donât confuse specific rituals or artifacts with
  being agile. Many of our projects adhere to a [typical Scrum-like process or
  make use of Kanban
  boards]({% page "/general-information-and-resources/how-we-collaborate/#project-rituals-and-meetings" %}),
  but itâs important that we donât convey to our partners that adherence to
  these rituals or use of a particular tool is equivalent to âbeing Agile.â
- We want to model an Agile approach for our partners as much as possible, in
  all of our disciplines. This may mean helping them to build a devOps pipeline
  to allow for an Agile release schedule, creating rough prototypes and testing
  them with users before weâre âsureâ of an approach, recommending a series of
  small procurements rather than a single large one, recommending a short
  experiment around a business process, or even suggesting a major pivot in our
  strategy. Again: Agile is a way of approaching problem-solving, not a
  methodology with inflexible boundaries.
- One caveat: though we believe employing Agile practices is an essential part
  of delivering high-quality user-centered services to the public, we also
  recognize that many of the projects we have the privilege of working on play a
  critical role in peopleâs daily lives. It may not always be appropriate to
  âexperimentâ when it comes to peopleâs access to critical government services.
  We always keep this in mind as we work to build our partnersâ capacity for
  more Agile workflows.

### Working with partners

Partners come to 18F because they want help with hard technical problems, often
involving creaky legacy systems and processes. We're not going to help them be
successful by shoving them out of the way and implementing the "right" way. We
will be successful by helping them be successful -- by teaching them repeatable,
useful modern development practices that help them fulfill the mission and serve
the public.

[Consulting and communicating effectively with
partners]({% page "/how-we-relate-to-partners/" %}) is how 18F is successful,
and it's how we help our partners be successful, too. You'll also want to read
up on [how we collaborate with partners]({% page "/how-we-collaborate/" %}),
which includes how we make remote collaboration work, how we model agile
practices, and a lot more.

## Diversity, accessibility, ethics and culture at TTS

TTS strives to thoughtfully and intentionally represent the broad American
populace we serve. We also believe in inclusive design â creating products and
environments that are accessible to all people, regardless of age, disability,
or other factors.

To that end, we strongly encourage reading over the [Diversity, equity, and
inclusion]({% page "/diversity" %}) materials in the handbook, and consider
joining the #diversity and #accessibility guilds.

We also strive to be intentional when interacting with one another and with
partners. One useful tip to start with today is to [fill out your Slack
profile]({% page "/tools/slack/getting-started/#profile" %}).

## Terming out

Your teammates terming out is a reality at TTS, where many people are
term-limited. Since you just started you may feel like that won't affect you for
a long time. That is, unfortunately, not the case.

PIFs are typically on one-year appointments, and Digital Corps Fellows on 2-year
appointments. 18F terms are typically now as long as 8 years. It may be a very
short time until you will be asked to be a subject matter expert, or join
leadership. You'll have to be comfortable trying new things. Jump in and pick
something up, even if you're not sure you have enough experience or context.
Pull as much information as you can out of veterans before they leave, and if
you see something that isn't written down yet, write it down. Before you know
it, you'll be the veteran. Start preparing for that from day one.

That's typical TTS operations and culture in a nutshell. At some point,
surprisingly soon, you'll have internalized most of these things. That's a great
time to come back and read this again for the bits you missed or forgot about.
Not long after that, you'll be helping a newcomer understand these things.

**Welcome to TTS!**
