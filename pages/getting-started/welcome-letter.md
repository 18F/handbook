You’ve just joined a remarkable group of people doing inspiring work.

We have an unprecedented opportunity to bring our government into the digital
age and transform the way it works. This opportunity is what brings us together
and keeps us excited about the work we do.

Your colleagues here are extraordinarily talented and dedicated, and they care
deeply about making a difference. You will find that we have a strong culture
that is inclusive, transparent, respectful, and upbeat.

Part of your job is being a great partner to our colleagues throughout
government. We strive not only to lead the way in technology, but to exemplify
the modern, collaborative, diverse culture we want to see. Our ability to
collaborate with colleagues across government is crucial to our ability to make
a difference.

We try to be both strategic and practical – strategic in always keeping the
bigger opportunity front of mind and practical in grounding our work in the
nitty gritty reality of getting particular projects done. We are committed to
working in an open, iterative and user-centered way with a strong focus on
delivery.

We aim to make our organization as agile and user-centric as our projects,
tapping into our collective ideas and insights. So please let us know if you see
any way we can improve.

Thank you again for bringing your talents to serve the public. We’re excited to
have you as a member of the TTS team.
