Our onboarding program helps you transition into TTS and adapt to our TTS
culture. To assist with this transition, we’ve put together a curriculum of
classes to help you navigate your first two weeks at TTS.

These classes will expose you to a variety of aspects of our organization,
introduce you to the people involved, and create opportunities for you to ask
questions.

Most of these classes are required, some are recommended, and others are
optional. If you have a conflicting team meeting or another commitment scheduled
at the same time as a class, prioritize your project work first! Most classes
recur on a two-week cycle so you can always join the class two weeks later or
read the course materials at your convenience.

It may seem like A LOT to take in at first, but go at your own pace, ask
questions, and feel free to follow up with the onboarding leads, your assigned
onboarding buddy, or your supervisor at any point — we’re all happy to help.

## Class Formats

We have varied the class format in order to best suit the content and your
schedule. The formats include:

- Video Conference – TTS leads will talk you through the content (sometimes with
  a presentation) and provide time for questions. _Although not required,
  turning on your camera is strongly advised._
- Self-Guided Documentation / Video – You will be directed to a handbook page,
  which typically includes a transcript page, a document, deck, and/or video to
  review on your own. We set up calendar invites for these classes only as a
  reminder for you to take them — nothing more. You do not need to take the
  self-guided classes at the specific time they show up on your calendar.

### Guidance to help you prioritize

- Required - Core classes that are critical to your onboarding and employment at
  TTS
- Recommended - Classes suggested for a better understanding of TTS
- Optional - Elective classes that are taken based on business need

## Classes

This section provides an overview of each of the classes, broken out into
topics.
