We’ve put together a curriculum of classes we encourage you to take during your
[first 90 days]({% page "/getting-started/" %}).

These classes will expose you to a variety of aspects of our organization,
introduce you to the people involved, and create opportunities to ask questions.

**Most of these classes are recommended, but optional** (with a few exceptions).
If you have a conflicting team meeting or another commitment, prioritize that
first! Most classes recur on a two-week cycle so you can always join the class 2
weeks later or read the materials at your convenience.

**There is A LOT to take in over your first 1-3 months.** So take it all at your
own pace, ask questions, and feel free to follow up with your class leads at any
point — they’re happy to help.

## Curriculum

This section provides an overview of each of the classes, broken into topics,
followed by [a calendar]({% page "/getting-started/classes/#calendar" %})
showing when classes are scheduled during each two-week cycle.

### Topics

- [Our Values and Principles at
  TTS]({% page "/getting-started/classes/#our-values-and-principles-at-tts" %})
- [Working in the
  Government]({% page "/getting-started/classes/#working-in-the-government" %})
- [Background and Operations at
  TTS]({% page "/getting-started/classes/#background-and-operations-at-tts" %})
- [Divisions of TTS]({% page "/getting-started/classes/#divisions-of-tts" %})
- [Online Learning University (OLU) Mandatory
  Training]({% page "/getting-started/classes/#online-learning-university-olu-mandatory-training" %})
- [Methods, Tidbits, and Case
  Studies]({% page "/getting-started/classes/#methods-tidbits-and-case-studies" %})

### Class Formats

Curricula like this can feel a bit overwhelming and exhausting, so we have
varied the class format in order to best suit the content and your schedule. The
formats include:

- **Video Conference** – (sometimes with a presentation) – TTS leads will talk
  you through the content and ask questions. _Turning on your camera is highly
  encouraged but not required._
- **Self-guided Doc / Video** – You will be directed to a handbook page, a
  document, deck, or video to review on your own. _No quiz or test after – we
  swear._ We set up calendar invites for these, only as reminders — nothing
  more.
- **Slack** – Hosted in the #TTS-Classes slack channel at a scheduled time, a
  lead will post messages overviewing a topic and resources and make space for
  questions. _Emoji reactions are welcome._
- **Coffee (Beta)** – A hybrid of a video conference and slack class, a lead
  will overview and casually discuss a topic via video conference. A summary and
  links are shared in the #TTS-Classes slack channel for posterity. _Turning on
  your camera is highly encouraged but not required._

### Guidance to help you prioritize:

- **Required (and in bold)** - Critical for your onboarding and employment
- Recommended - Suggested for better understanding TTS
- As Needed – Additional and valuable context depending on your interests or
  office
