## Initial setup for travel

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
[Start the First-time travel guide to setup >]({% page "/first-time-travel-get-in-concur/" %})

In order to travel officially in TTS, you need to, at minimum, [get set up in
Concur]({% page "/first-time-travel-get-in-concur/" %})\*, GSA's travel system.
Flights or Amtrak booked in Concur are paid for directly by GSA-- no travel card
required.

You'll also want to [apply for a GSA travel
card]({% page "/first-time-travel-travel-card/" %}), and once you receive it,
[update your Concur
profile]({% page "/first-time-travel-complete-concur-profile" %}). This process
takes about two weeks. In the meantime, you won't be able to make hotel
reservations in Concur. It is recommended that you make all of your reservations
via AdTrav at (877) 472-6716 until your card arrives. You will need to use your
personal funds for all travel expenses other than flights/rail, but can be
reimbursed for all official expenses when you [complete a voucher upon your
return]({% page "/travel-and-leave/travel-and-leave-policies/travel-guide-3-travel/" %}).

\*_Note: there are [special
procedures]({% page "/first-time-travel-get-in-concur-pre-olu/" %}) for staff
who need to get into Concur to travel during their first week and may not yet
have access to OLU to complete the required IT security trainings._

## Brief overview of how to travel

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
[Start booking travel >]({% page "/travel-and-leave/travel-and-leave-policies/travel-guide-2-book-travel/" %})

Once you are [set up in Concur]({% page "/first-time-travel-get-in-concur/" %})
and your [travel card]({% page "/first-time-travel-travel-card/" %}) is on its
way, there are three main parts of the travel process to be aware of.

### 1. Book your travel and submit a plan for approval

- You can [book flights, rail trips, hotels, and rental cars][travel-guide-2] in
  [Concur](https://travel.gsa.gov) or by calling AdTrav at (877) 472-6716.
- [Complete your trip information][completing-trip-information], and continue
  [stamping to submit][stamp-and-submit] to the travel team for approval.
- Get approval via [email][authorizing-official] from your [authorizing
  official][who-is-my-ao] or through the [event request process][event-request].

The approval timeline will vary, but the whole process typically takes between a
few days to a week.

### 2. Actually travel

Keep [travel card policies and reimbursement rules][travel-guide-3] as you
travel, so you'll know the right times to use your GSA travel card and which
receipts you need to keep with you.

### 3. File your voucher and get reimbursed

Now it's time to [get reimbursed for your travel][travel-guide-4] by filing your
voucher. You can also get reimbursed for other things via this method, such as
[local travel][local-travel] or, for supervisors, [professional liability
insurance][professional-liability-insurance].

**For unusual travel situations, there are a few additional guides to be aware
of:**

  plans]({% page "/travel-guide-a-amended-authorizations/" %})

  travel]({% page "/travel-guide-b-after-hours-emergency-travel-authorizations" %})
- Combining official and personal travel, including [extensions at personal
  expense]({% page "/travel-and-leave/travel-and-leave-policies/travel-guide-faq/#what-if-i-am-extending-travel-for-personal-reasons" %}),
  and [travel to and from cities other than one's home location and
  worksite]({% page "/travel-and-leave/travel-and-leave-policies/travel-guide-faq/#what-if-i-am-returning-to-or-traveling-from-a-location-other-than-home" %}).
- [Traveling for multiple
  projects]({% page "/travel-and-leave/travel-and-leave-policies/travel-guide-faq/#what-if-i-am-traveling-for-multiple-projects" %})
- [Issues with
  reimbursement]({% page "/travel-and-leave/travel-and-leave-policies/travel-guide-faq/#issues-with-reimbursement" %})
