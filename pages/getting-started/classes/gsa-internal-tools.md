_This post provides information on how to work with GSA's web tools and your
GSA-issued equipment._

## GSA tools

Most of GSA's internal tools are accessible via our Agency's intranet
[Insite](https://insite.gsa.gov). You must be on the GSA network to connect if you work
remotely. [Instructions for logging in are here]({% page "/how-to-log-in/" %}).
Here's an overview of what you can access (you can click the names in this table
to scroll down the page):

| Name                                          | What we use it for                                                                                                                                         | Login system                           |

### Browser requirements

Please note that while many of these websites work fine in Chrome or Firefox,
you _must_ use Safari or Internet Explorer to access Online University.

Let's cover each of these tools in a bit more detail.

## BookIt!

[BookIt!](https://bookit.gsa.gov/mobile/auth/spnego/spnegoLogin.jsp) is what
you'll use to reserve a desk or a meeting room within a GSA building.

Here are some tips for employees that frequent an office:

<ul>
  <li>
    To periodically reserve a workstation in D.C.:
    <ol>
      <li>Go to `Profile → View Your Profile → Edit Profile`. </li>
      <li>Pick the workstation you'd like to reserve each day. TTS is on floor 3, Wing 1 and part of Wing 0 (Rooms 3007-3011)).</li>
      <li>Category: Workstation, Floor 3: Wing 1 or Floor 3: Wing 0. BookIT shows which workstations are equipped with Mac monitors.</li>
      <li>Choose the day of the week (today)</li>
      <li>Choose start and end times (typically, 9am and 6pm)</li>
      <li>Click save</li>
    </ol>
    Once your one-click settings are set up, you only have to hit two buttons each day: One-Click and Express Check-In (the top button on the left — arrow into door)
  </li>
  <li>BookIT! can remember your office location so you won't have to scroll through drop-down menus every time you need to reserve a meeting room. To save your office location settings, go to <code>Profile → View Your Profile → Edit Profile.</code>   </li>
  <li>BookIT! also allows you to add "delegates," or people who can book rooms and/or check in on your behalf. To do that, go to <code>Profile → View Your Profile → Delegates → Edit Profile</code>.</li>
  <li>Some employees have expressed difficulty in logging into BookIT! If you're having difficulty, try bookmarking <a href="https://bookit.gsa.gov/mobile/auth/spnego/spnegoLogin.jsp">the BookIT! login page</a>. It should immediately ask for your ENT password. In DC, you can also email <a href="mailto:1800ftenantsupport@gsa.gov">1800tenantsupport@gsa.gov</a> and ask to be added to the TTS org they should be able to add you to the list in a day.</li>
 </ul>

## Employee Express

[Employee Express](https://www.employeeexpress.gov/) is used to view your
paystub, change your withholdings, change your health insurance plan, and change
your address.

If you're new to GSA, it'll take a few weeks for IT to set up your account. (You
should have access after your first paycheck.) You’ll receive a
`Welcome to Employee Express` email with a security code.

1. You **must** click the first link first to activate your account.
2. Sign in with your temporary ID number (last five digits of your social
   security number).
3. After you activate your account, you can set up your login ID and password.
4. Then, go back to the welcome email and click the second link to log in.

Once your account is setup, be sure to log in right away as that initial access
expires within a few days. If you have trouble logging in or need to contact the
Employee Express Help Desk, click on the **(?)** icon in the top right hand
corner of the [Employee Express](https://www.employeeexpress.gov/) main page and
fill out the "Help Request" form.

See [Benefits]({% page "/benefits" %}) for more details about Employee Express.

## HR Links

<a href="https://hrlinks.gsa.gov/">HR Links</a> is what you'll
use to [request and document leave]({% page "/tools/hrlinks/" %}) (sick, annual,
bereavement, and more) as well as access your personnel file (your salary, your
GS level, your supervisor, your past performance rating(s), and information
about health insurance plan).

## IT Service Desk

_Also known as the GSA IT Help Desk or Service Now._

If you have any issues with a GSA-maintained system or website, you'll need to
contact the IT service desk through:

- [The Service Portal](https://servicedesk.gsa.gov/), where you can submit a
  ticket or live chat
- Call them at 866-450-5250
- Email them at [itservicedesk@gsa.gov](mailto:itservicedesk@gsa.gov)

They are available 6am-9pm ET. If your ticket gets stuck, you can ask them to
escalate it (just say "can you escalate this for me, please"). If that doesn't
work, [reach out to the Tech
Portfolio]({% page "/office-of-solutions/tech-operations/#questions" %}).

If you need to reset your ENT password, follow [these
instructions]({% page "/getting-started/how-to-log-in/#changing-your-ent-password" %}).

## Self Service

The
[Self Service](https://gsa.servicenowservices.com/sp/?id=kb_article&sys_id=8ce331fcdb3c7f842b02388d7c961933)
application is used to install desktop software on Macs. It can be found under
`Applications` on your Mac. If a piece of desktop software you want isn't
appearing there, you'll need to [request it]({% page "/software/" %}).

For Windows, see
[these instructions](https://insite.gsa.gov/employee-resources/information-technology/do-it-yourself-self-help/software-and-applications/software-requests-and-software-updates).

## Office supplies

Access to general office supplies varies based on your location — see our
[office guides]({% page "/#tts-locations" %}). The D.C. office has a supply
center on the first floor of the GSA building. The supply center offers paper,
pens, notebooks, and other basic office supplies (many of which can also be
found in printer rooms throughout the building). See also:

- [Software]({% page "/software/" %})
- [Computer peripherals]({% page "/getting-started/equipment/#peripherals" %})

If you need office supplies that aren’t available in your office, software, or
need to make any other request for TTS to purchase, read on
[here]({% page "/purchase-requests" %}) for what to do next.
