This page provides an overview of the TTS Tech Portfolio team (formally known as
the "Infrastructure" team).

Our team helps other TTS teams with security, compliance, and technology best
practices. As a part of TTS Classes, you will review
[this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iQP1S_PbJyOaeTlPEpD9oxal3kgA0bb2YNYbN56fJSk/edit#)
and then complete this
[confirmation survey](https://goo.gl/forms/VP4Ci9Ed3r6UxG6H3).

### TL;DR

- TTS Tech Portfolio is not just for engineers; it fundamentally shapes how we
  work.
- If you're an engineer of any kind, the most important part of your job in the
  government is security. Start here.
- If you're not sure you can do something, please ask first. We promise to get
  you an answer quickly.

### What you’ll learn

1. How to make sure you're not breaking the law
2. How to secure your laptop
3. What it means to work in the public

## About TTS Tech Portfolio

### Obeying the law

Rule #1 is if you don't see us doing something already, and you can't find
express authorization to do it, please [ask the Tech
Portfolio]({% page "/tech-portfolio/#questions" %}). We promise to get you an
answer quickly. If there is software that chapters need to accomplish their
mission or don't know how to get, see the [Software]({% page "/software/" %})
page.

### Security

You've probably heard about the
[Office of Personnel Management (OPM) data breach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Personnel_Management_data_breach),
and you probably know about the NSA. Everyone at TTS is responsible for our
organization's security and ensuring that the private data of the public is
safe.

The most important part of your job is security. 18F has its own
[security standards](https://pages.18f.gov/before-you-ship/security/) around the
software we develop. Be sure to [secure your
Macbook]({% page "/equipment/#laptop" %}) and be sure
[FileVault](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204837) is turned on.

Take care when connecting applications to each other. While such connections can
provide workflow conveniences, they also open us up to security violations.
Often times this is an OAuth integration. Before connecting applications
together, for example enabling a Slack-to-Google Docs plugin, please contact the
Tech Portfolio.

### The public interest

As a federal employee, you yourself have practically no right to privacy in
connection with your work. Anything you say or do - in an email, a phone call, a
private GitHub repo, a Slack direct message, etc - can be monitored, recorded,
and turned into a Federal record. If you don't want the government to know
something, use a personal device or service. If you're using TTS, GSA, or
Gov-wide provided anything (software, tools, devices, etc), you are actively
consenting to being monitored.

This is an easy place to make mistakes, but it's also another great place to
introduce another rule of thumb. Rule #2 is: Either everyone in the public can
participate, or no one can. You alone cannot decide why Person A has access to
something but not Person B. You alone, for example, can't decide if a friend of
yours, especially a friend outside of government, can help on a project (this
includes things like contributing code and reviewing a Google Doc) if that
project itself is not already contributable by the public at large. There are
multiple laws and regs that interact with each other around this space, but the
bottom line is that a democratic government cannot make capricious decisions
around who gets in.

That isn't to say that TTS can't solicit public input. We absolutely can. We can
also limit access through a process, but we need a process that is both (1)
initially open to everyone and (2) is clearly documented. This also applies to
acquisitions or procurement, and the very complex laws around government
finance.

This brings us to Rule #3: You cannot spend a single penny, or create the
expectation for a single penny to be spent, without prior authorization.
Anything involving money must trace back to approvals. You can find out all
about purchase approvals on the [Purchase
Requests]({% page "/purchase-requests/" %}) page.

### TTS Tech Portfolio rules

There are some things that you might have been used to doing outside of
government that you cannot do now.

You cannot use or deploy to whatever third party tool you want without [asking
the Tech Portfolio]({% page "/office-of-solutions/tech-portfolio/#questions" %})
or by submitting a [Google Apps
Script]({% page "/google-drive/#google-apps-script" %}) .

If you're an engineer of any kind, the most important part of your job in the
government at the moment is **security.** If you're building anything, a good
place to start is
[18F's security standards](https://pages.18f.gov/before-you-ship/security/).

The three rules of Infrastructure are:

1. If you don't see us doing it already and you can't find express authorization
   to do something, please ask first.
2. Either everyone in the public can participate, or no one can.
3. You cannot spend a single penny, or or create the expectation for a single
   penny to be spent, without prior approval.

## Questions

### Am I violating federal records law if I delete a project from my personal computer?

If that's the canonical and only source of that information, yes. If that
information is stored elsewhere (like GitHub or Google Drive), no.

### What do I ask TTS Ops vs TTS Tech Portfolio?

TTS Ops focuses on what would normally be considered the "back office" financial
matters, procurement, and space operations. Infrastructure focuses on our
digital infrastructure and development methodologies. All operations teams work
very closely together and there many areas we have joint ownership. Don't worry
about the specifics; we're always happy to direct you in the right direction.
