page]({% page "/benefits-links/" %}).**

GSA requires that you enroll in many of the benefits offered to you within the
first 60 days of work. Otherwise, you'll have to wait for Open Season, which
typically runs from the Monday of the second full work week in November through
the Monday of the second full work week in December.

## Submitting benefit forms

### New hires

Follow
[these instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vA6FRVqUnI-Z9XCgx9p6nZ7FS8cmpj7X42_hbiZfLAY/edit#heading=h.gjdgxs)
to make your benefits selections in [HR Links](https://hrlinks.gsa.gov/). You
can email your GSA HR Benefits contact listed in the
[Benefits & Support Contacts for TTS Employees](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15glvq9UakKUN8XTRTa6gRkhBHm2whhQyAGmf8ibTtBs/edit)
document if you have any questions.

Note: if you have dependents that you wish to cover, begin by going to
**HRLinks**, click the **Life Events** tile, and select a **New Employee** life
event. It will give you the option to add dependents.

### Current employees

If you are revising benefits due to a change in life event (for example, getting
married or having a child), you have from 30 days before the event to 60 days
after the event to make changes. Outside of this window, you will need to wait
for the annual open enrollment period to adjust your benefits. Some life event
changes require documentation, such as a marriage license. You may start the
form and return to it once you have the required documentation.

#### Healthcare plan

Log into HR Links and navigate to the Life Event section:

- Compass (upper right hand corner)
- Navigator
- Self Service
- Benefits
- Life Event

From there, you will be asked to select a life event. You will be walked through
the process to upload documents, add beneficiaries (family members on your
insurance), and change plans.

#### Dental and vision plan

You may change your dental and vision plan and beneficiaries by logging into
your BENEFEDS account online or by calling 1-877-888-3337.

## Flexible spending accounts

[Flexible spending accounts](https://www.opm.gov/healthcare-insurance/flexible-spending-accounts/)
(FSA) allow you to pay for
[eligible out-of-pocket health care and dependent care expenses](https://www.fsafeds.com/support/eligibleexpenses)
with pre-tax dollars. They cannot be used to pay any type of premium, and you
must use all the money in your account by the end of the year or you risk
forfeiture of the unused funds. However, there is a grace period. If you have
unused funds in your FSA account and incur expenses from January 1 through March
15, you have until April 30 to submit claims against the prior year.

Common reimbursements include gym memberships (with a doctor's note),
over-the-counter medication (with a doctor's note), and eyeglasses.

There are three kinds of FSA:

- **Health Care Flexible Spending Accounts** are used to pay for qualified
  medical costs and health care expenses not covered by your Federal Employees
  Health Benefits
- **Limited Expense Health Care Flexible Spending Account (LEXHCFSA)** is only
  available to employees who enroll in a FEHB program or under a High Deductible
  Health Plan (HDHP) with a Health Savings Account (HSA). Expenses are limited
  to dental and vision care services and products that meet the IRS definition
  of medical care.
- **Dependent Care Flexible Spending Accounts** are used to pay for eligible
  dependent care expenses such as child care for children under age 13 or
  children who are physically or mentally incapable of self-care. In some cases,
  they're also used to pay for elder care.

Flexible Spending Accounts run on a calendar year and enrollment into the
program is closed on October 1 of each year. New and newly eligible employees
who wish to [enroll in this program](https://www.fsafeds.com/GEM) must do so
within 60 days of their start date and prior to October 1. If you miss this
deadline, you must wait until Open Season (mid-November) to enroll for the
following calendar year.

Please note that FSA does not automatically renew each year; you must re-enroll
annually.

## Insurance

### Health

The
[Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB)](https://www.opm.gov/healthcare-insurance/healthcare/)
program offers a wide selection of health plans for eligible employees and their
eligible family members.

Eligible employees may choose from:

- Fee-for-Service plans and their Preferred Provider Organizations (PPOs);
- Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs) for those who live within the
  geographic area serviced by the plan; and
- Consumer-Drive and High-Deductible health plans that offer catastrophic risk
  protection with higher deductibles, health savings and reimbursement accounts,
  and lower premiums.

The Office of Personnel Management lists the
[plans available in each state](https://www.opm.gov/healthcare-insurance/healthcare/plan-information/).

New employees, employees who move outside of the area covered by their plan, and
employees who have certain life qualifying events have 60 days to enroll,
modify, change, or cancel their plans. If you do not fit into one of those
categories, you can change, modify, cancel, or enroll during Open Season. Open
Season typically runs from the Monday of the second full workweek in November
through the Monday of the second full workweek in December. OPM provides a
[detailed FAQ on eligibility](https://www.opm.gov/healthcare-insurance/Guide-Me/Federal-Employees/#url=Health)
for federal employees.

To enroll or reenroll in FEHB, elect not to enroll in FEHB, change your
enrollment, cancel your enrollment, or suspend your enrollment you must do so in
HR Links by taking the following steps:

- Select the Benefits Library icon
- Click on the Forms Center
- Select "Health Benefits Election Form"

  - a list of event codes can be found by going to the side bar and clicking the
    second to last bookmark titled "Tables of Permissable Changes..."

- Once you click "Submit" the documents get sent to the cpc benefits team where
  they can review and process these actions.

The earliest date your insurance can be effective is two weeks after your start
date, assuming you send your documents in immediately. You get access to
[Employee Express](https://www.employeeexpress.gov), where you can check the
status of your health insurance, after your first paycheck. You can also call
your providers directly to confirm enrollment. Questions? Contact the
[FAS Benefits Specialist](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15glvq9UakKUN8XTRTa6gRkhBHm2whhQyAGmf8ibTtBs/edit)
who corresponds to your last name.

### Dental

To qualify for
[dental insurance](https://www.opm.gov/healthcare-insurance/dental-vision/), you
must sign up within 60 days of joining TTS, after a qualifying life event, or
during Open Season. Some health insurance plans come with dental coverage, so
you may not need dental insurance. Read your plan booklet to see what's covered.
You can sign up for dental coverage on [Benefeds](https://www.benefeds.com/).

> **Note**: To create your account for Benefeds, you may need to contact their
> customer service via the phone number listed on their
> [Contact page](https://www.benefeds.com/contact).

### Vision

To qualify for
[vision insurance](https://www.opm.gov/healthcare-insurance/dental-vision/), you
must sign up within 60 days of joining TTS, after a qualifying life event, or
during Open Season. Some health insurance plans come with vision coverage, so
you may not need vision insurance. Read your plan booklet to see what's covered.
You can sign up for vision coverage on [Benefeds](https://www.benefeds.com/).

If you have an eye appointment but have yet to receive your card(s), you can
look up your Vision Care subscriber ID online. To do so, log on to
[Benefeds](https://www.benefeds.com/).

> **Note**: To create your account for Benefeds, you may need to contact their
> customer service via the phone number listed on their
> [Contact page](https://www.benefeds.com/contact).

### Filing an insurance complaint

If you're having difficulty resolving an issue or getting clarification from
your insurer, follow these steps:

1. Email [FEHB@opm.gov](mailto:FEHB@opm.gov) and make sure to include:

   - Name of the insurer
   - Issue that you need resolved
   - What outcome you would like
   - A huge thanks to the team that wrangles these complaints

2. They forward the issue to the company and use the complaint to see if there's
   a pattern of abuse by the company

   - The company fixes the issue at this point

3. If you do not hear back within a reasonable timeframe, follow up with
   FEHB@opm.gov

## Leave

Please use [HR Links](https://corporateapps.gsa.gov/hr-links/) to request sick
leave and annual leave. For any leave-related questions, please contact
[cpc.benefits-retirement@gsa.gov](mailto:cpc.benefits-retirement@gsa.gov).

For more information on Leave, including sick, funeral, unpaid, parental,
advanced, and religious, please reference the [Leave]({% page "/leave" %}) page.

## Lunch and break periods

You can take a 30-minute or one-hour lunch break. Lunch breaks are unpaid, so
you need to make sure you work eight hours per day. For example, if you come in
at 8:00 a.m. and take a 30-minute lunch, you’d work til 4:30 p.m. If you took an
hour lunch break, you’d work til 5:00 p.m.

You get two 15-minute breaks per day. These breaks do not extend the work day,
since they’re paid. If you came in through the Peace Corps, you may have
different options. Contact your bargaining unit or union directly for details.

## Paychecks

We are paid biweekly. You’ll receive your first paycheck about three weeks after
your start date. This is because every TTS employee starts work at the beginning
of a pay period. It takes a week after the end of a pay period for a direct
deposit to be made. See the
[GSA Payroll Calendar](https://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/102507) to determine
future pay cycles.

Please direct questions to the payroll help desk: **1-844-303-6515** or
[email them](mailto:kc-payroll.finance@gsa.gov).

To see your recent pay stubs:

1. Sign into [Employee Express](https://www.employeeexpress.gov). If you don't
   have access yet, email
   [kc-payroll.finance@gsa.gov](mailto:kc-payroll.finance@gsa.gov) to request a
   copy. They’ll send it to you in a password-locked zip file.
2. Click the "View Your Earnings and Leave Statement" link in the middle of the
   page.
3. Choose the appropriate pay period in the drop-down menu.

For help interpreting the many boxes on your paystub, see
[How to Read Your Leave and Earnings Statement](https://www.usbr.gov/gp/employment/neo/tab6/ELS2012.pdf).
You can also watch
[the recording of 'A Beginner's Guide to Your Earnings and Leave Statement](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1p3XRDPkEhqjKBI9UV3wQsWGLWLaf-Cnv/view),'
a session that a TTS teammate offered.

Note that the gross income in your paycheck is a little less than your annual
income / 26 paychecks. The difference lies in the way the federal government
calculates hourly rates from annual salary. The federal government divides the
annual salary by 2087 hours rather than 2080 hours (26 pay periods x 80 hours)
to determine hourly rates.

This is because about every 11 years or so there are 27 pay periods rather than
26 pay periods (2015 was such a year for GSA payrolled employees). Here is an
article that explains this:
[Why your paychecks don't always add up](https://www.govexec.com/federal-news/1999/09/pay-and-benefits-watch-why-your-paychecks-dont-always-add-up/4415/).

## Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF)

Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) is a government program that offers
forgiveness of federal student loans under certain conditions. Further
information on the program and whether you qualify for PSLF can be found on
[the PSLF webpage](https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/public-service).

**_Please Note:_** The Department of Education recommends that you submit the
PSLF form annually or when you change employers. It will make it much easier
once you are ready to apply for forgiveness after 10 years of employment in
public service! If you do not submit the PSLF form with your employment
certification annually, then at the time you apply for forgiveness, you will be
required to submit employment certification for each employer you worked for
while making the required 120 qualifying monthly payments.

As a GSA employee, you are eligible for PSLF (assuming you satisfy the other
conditions).

To fill out your PSLF application and obtain employer verification:

1. Download the application PDF from the

## Retirement

### FERS (Federal Employees Retirement System)

The Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS) is the retirement plan that all
employees pay into during their federal employment. A percentage of each
paycheck is withheld by GSA and put into FERS.

Employees must have at least 5 years of
[creditable service](https://www.opm.gov/retirement-services/fers-information/creditable-service/)
to be eligible for FERS payments upon retirement.

If you leave government before becoming eligible for FERS retirement, you can
request that your contributions be returned in a lump sum payment: see [leaving
TTS]({% page "/leaving-tts/" %}) for more information.

If you served as an AmeriCorps VISTA volunteer, a Peace Corps Volunteer, and/or
in the military, you may be eligible to “buy back” your service. “Buying back”
your military/volunteer service allows the amount of time you served to be
applied toward your FERS retirement calculations.

As an example, if you served in the Peace Corps for 2 years and buy back your
service, that amount of time would be considered creditable service and would
increase your “length of service”
[FERS payment calculation](https://www.opm.gov/retirement-services/fers-information/computation/).

The calculations for FERS retirement can be complex, and there is paperwork to
complete. We recommend carefully reviewing all information and talking to HR
personnel as needed. Visit the following websites, Slack channels, and email the
GSA HR Benefits contact listed in the
[Benefits & Support Contacts for TTS Employees](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15glvq9UakKUN8XTRTa6gRkhBHm2whhQyAGmf8ibTtBs/edit)
document.

- [Military service](https://www.dfas.mil/civilianemployees/militaryservice/militaryservicedeposits.html)
  and {% slack_channel "vets" %}

  and {% slack_channel "rpcvs" %}

### TSP (Thrift Savings Plan)

Employees at TTS are eligible to participate in the
[Thrift Savings Plan](https://www.tsp.gov/index.html) (TSP). For more
information on TSP, please refer to the
[TSP Insite page](https://insite.gsa.gov/topics/hr-pay-and-leave/benefits/thrift-savings-plan?term=tsp).

To start, change, or stop your contributions, you'll need to fill out
[Form TSP-1](https://www.tsp.gov/PDF/formspubs/tsp-1.pdf).

You can also update TSP directly in [HR
Links]({% page "/travel-and-leave/leave/#logging-into-hr-links" %}) by following
this
[visual guide](https://corporateapps.gsa.gov/corporateapps/files/Updating-TSP-Traditional-or-Roth.pdf)
or these steps:

1. After you sign into HR Links, click "Benefits Summary"
2. Click on the **TSP** tile/row to view and edit your contribution amounts
3. Click **Save**

If you ever move, you can update your address for TSP by emailing it to both the
[Consolidated Processing Center](mailto:cpc.personnel@gsa.gov) and the
[GSA Payroll Office](mailto:KC-Payroll.Finance@gsa.gov). Payroll will notify the
TSP office of your new address.

To transfer your previous retirement account into your TSP, you'll need to fill
out a [Form TSP-60](https://www.tsp.gov/PDF/formspubs/tsp-60.pdf) for every
account you want to roll over. If you need help, you can call them by dialing
**1-877-968-3778**. Be sure to have your TSP account number and your SSN and
mailing address handy.

If you have been contributing to a 401k, 403b, or a similar plan at your
previous employer, your total contribution for all similar plans cannot be
higher than [the annual limit](https://www.tsp.gov/bulletins/20-8/).

You may need to include a special additional statement with your tax return
explaining you rolled over your IRA to the TSP. For guidance on this, see the
[IRS interactive guide to "Do I Need to Report the Transfer or Rollover of an IRA or Retirement Plan on My Tax Return?"](https://www.irs.gov/help/ita/do-i-need-to-report-the-transfer-or-rollover-of-an-ira-or-retirement-plan-on-my-tax-return).

## Training

TTS team members are eligible for many professional development and training
opportunities. For more information, see [attending
conferences]({% page "/conferences-events-training" %}).

## Transit subsidies

See the [transit benefit]({% page "/transit-benefit/" %}) page.
