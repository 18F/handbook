This content provides best practices for logging into your various government
accounts and apps.

## ENT (enterprise) login

This is your account for signing into systems administered by GSA, including
your email, calendar, and Google Drive. Your ENT account name is in the form
`FirstnameMiddleinitialLastname` (Ex: `JohnASmith`). For guidance on secure
passwords, reference this [page]({% page "/password-requirements" %}).

When you login with ENT while not connected to a GSA wireless network, you will
be prompted to select "This is a public computer" or "This is a private
computer" (see image below). You should always select "This is a private
computer" unless you are logging in on a computer that's not your government
computer or a computer that you personally own (Ex: a library computer).

### Changing your ENT password

You must change your ENT password immediately after you start with GSA and every
90 days thereafter. This is your password for signing into systems administered
by GSA, including your email, calendar, and Google Drive. Go to
[reset.gsa.gov](https://reset.gsa.gov) to change your password.

Locking and unlocking your workstation when you are connected to the network in
the office or remotely is a required step to ensure the new ENT password
is cached properly.

Detailed ENT password reset instructions can be found
[at ServiceNow KB0022142](https://gsa.servicenowservices.com/sp?sys_kb_id=5b0981db1b8c6d50566763dbe54bcbcc&id=kb_article_view&sysparm_rank=4&sysparm_tsqueryId=117ba05ddb094610835a4a391396194e).

## Change or reset your Macbook login password

Users with expiring local passwords (not ENT passwords) will be prompted to
change their password and must follow security requirements. Users may see the prompt if their password is due to expire within 14 days. 

You can change the password that you use to log into your Mac or reset the
password by following
[ServiceNow KB0024344](https://gsa.servicenowservices.com/sp/?sys_kb_id=361130c11b2829109fffa93be54bcba8&id=kb_article_view&sysparm_rank=1&sysparm_tsqueryId=220b62411b04fd90164442ecac4bcb7d).

Users must follow security requirements:

1. Password must be changed every 90 days (password aging);
1. Userâ€™s last 24 passwords may not be reused (password history); and
1. Password changed whenever password is forgotten or compromised, regardless of
   age.
1. Passwords must be 16 characters

## Logging into apps with your GSA Google account

Some applications can be logged into using your GSA Google account. Just make
sure that you don't grant Google access to anything beyond basic data; "Basic
Info" or "Limited Access to Data and Files" are both approved options that are
considered basic data. Any integration beyond basic requires a
[GSA IT Help Desk ticket](https://servicedesk.gsa.gov), you can also start a
ticket by emailing `itservicedesk@gsa.gov`.

You can check your account permissions
[here](https://myaccount.google.com/permissions).
