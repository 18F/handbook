GSA issues every TTS employee a badge, laptop, and phone. Your laptop should be
ready before your first day, but your phone may not be.

The Onboarding Team submits your new hire account request, which includes your
badge, phone, and laptop. Your laptop and phone will be shipped to your home
address on file.

## Distributed employees

Badges are shipped to your local GSA badging office. You will receive an email
once your badge is available for pick-up. At that point, you will be prompted to
make an appointment. Send an email to
[hspd12.security@gsa.gov](mailto:hspd12.security@gsa.gov) if you have any
questions regarding your badge.

## Laptop

Your supervisor will determine if you need a MacBook Pro or PC laptop. In the
past, most TTS employees have been issued an Apple MacBook Pro computer, but
recently due to supply chain shortages as well as a few other factors, TTS does
not have the current inventory to give each new hire a MacBook at this time.

The Onboarding Team will send you information (including your laptop tracking
number) prior to your first day.

See [information about using PIV card readers with GSA-issued
MacBooks]({% page "/piv/" %}).

### MacBook Operating System

Your MacBook will come preloaded with the latest, GSA-approved/supported
operating system. Please wait to do any operating system upgrades (including
patches) until notified by GSA IT.

### Rules

**Lock your computer before leaving it.** Press the **Control + Shift + Power**
keys on newer MacBooks or **Control + Shift + Eject** on older MacBooks with
optical drives.

**Encrypt all portable media that will connect to any TTS system.** You can
apply FileVault encryption to removable USB drives and external hard drives by
right-clicking the drive on your desktop and clicking **Encrypt**. You must
choose a strong password you can remember, as your drive will require the
password to mount and retrieve data once encrypted.

**GSA IT manages software updates.** You should not install updates or major
version upgrades yourself. You are responsible for applying updates and
restarting only when a GSA notification appears on your device.

### Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)

[GSA has implemented a BYOD policy](https://insite.gsa.gov/employee-resources/information-technology/do-it-yourself-self-help/mobile-devices-phones-tablets)
that allows users to connect their non-GSA procured mobile devices, which have
been previously approved by IT security, to GSA resources in a native fashion,
utilizing the GSA network. Please note, only approved smartphones and tablets
can be connected to the GSA network. Personal laptops cannot be connected
directly to the GSA network at any GSA facility. For more information, please
reference Section 4.2 of the
[IT Security Procedural Guide](https://www.gsa.gov/cdnstatic/Securing_Mobile_Devices_and_Applications_%5BCIO_IT_Security_12-67_Rev_4%5D_01-26-2018.pdf#page=11).

For users who work on a FISMA system that wish to use their personal
laptop/computer (at a non-GSA facility), the assigned ISSO/ISSM for the
application must accept the associated risk(s), obtain approval from the
Authorizing Official, and document the use of the personally owned computer
within the System Security Plan (SSP).

For users who do not work directly on a FISMA system who wish to use their
personal machine (at a non-GSA facility), please consult with
ispcompliance@gsa.gov to review the BYOD policy with regards to your specific
needs and use cases. You can also post general questions in the
[AskIT Chatter Page](https://gsa.my.salesforce.com/_ui/core/chatter/groups/GroupProfilePage?g=0F9300000001I35).

**Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) can never be stored on a personal
machine. Utilize Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) to the maximum extent
possible.**

### Loaners

You can
[request a loaner PC through the IT Service Desk](https://gsa.servicenowservices.com/sp/?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=403e07527897a400ce3ddff91a649427&sysparm_category=2318125b7cec0100a6e757fe35f45f9f).

GSA IT does not currently have a Mac Loaner Program, but can provide loaners for
exceptional cases like needing a machine for a
[Third-Party Assessment Organization (3PAO)](https://www.fedramp.gov/assessors/)
that needs to match the machines of developers on the team.

1. Open a service now ticket requesting `GSA Hardware Request - Loaner`.
1. Provide rationale for request. Example:

   > ProjectX.gov needs a GSA hardened with the latest approved MacOSX with TTS
   > users permission for 3PAO penetration testing. This is part of an (annual)
   > assessment for FedRAMP Low/Moderate/High FISMA A&A...

1. Include the contact and shipping information.
1. Provide a user name on the device. Example: `3PAOtester01`.
1. Help desk will create a shipping label and mail out loaner to the receiving
   party.

If GSA IT doesn't have any availble inventory to issue a loaner, please [contact
the Tech Portfolio]({% page "/office-of-solutions/tech-portfolio/#questions" %})
and they will work with you to determine a suitable alternative.

### Admin rights

For new hires receiving a MacBook, the onboarding team will submit a request for
Mac admin rights for all new hires who require them, per supervisor request.

For current TTS employees, see the
[**procedures to request admin rights**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xepZsh83lxPDykrb1NXoeHxj8m78qsdW-9KqzO_CHOQ/edit).

#### Prompts

If you are getting a prompt to upgrade desktop software
(`<software> wants to make changes`), try reinstalling the given piece of
software through [Self
Service]({% page "/getting-started/classes/gsa-internal-tools/#self-service" %}).
If the software is not available there, please [contact the GSA IT Service
Desk]({% page "/getting-started/classes/gsa-internal-tools/#it-service-desk" %}).

### XCode command line tools

XCode command line tools can be installed or upgraded through [Self
Service]({% page "/getting-started/classes/gsa-internal-tools/#self-service" %}).
If already installed and up to date, it won't show up. Note this doesn't install
the XCode application.

## Phone

All TTS employees are issued an Apple iPhone. Prior to joining, the TTS
Onboarding Team will submit a ticket via the GSA IT Service Desk for new hires
to receive a work phone. It will be shipped via UPS and require signature upon
delivery. It will arrive within your first few weeks. There will be
instructions, along with a phone number for you to call, for assistance with
activating your iPhone.

### Rules

- **Change the phone's passcode.** It must be longer than 14 characters and
  contain both letters and numbers. The code should be known only to you.
- **Activate
  [Find My iPhone](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH2697?locale=en_US).** If
  you're on an Android phone, activate
  [Android Device Manager](https://www.google.com/android/devicemanager).
- **You are responsible for applying software updates.** When you receive a
  notification that an update is available, you should apply the update as soon
  as possible.
- After GSA IT provisions your phone, set up two-factor verification:

  - If you don't have access to [HR
    Links]({% page "/getting-started/classes/gsa-internal-tools/#hr-links" %}),
    email [hspd12.security@gsa.gov](mailto:hspd12.security@gsa.gov) and ask them
    to add your work cell phone number (which you may or may not have) and your
    personal cell phone number to your GSA Credential and Identity Management
    System (GCIMS) profile.
  - Once you have access to [HR
    Links]({% page "/getting-started/classes/gsa-internal-tools/#hr-links" %}),
    you can update your contact information there. You'll find it under
    **Navigator > Employee Self Service > View/Update My Personal Info > Phone
    Number Change (USF)**; make sure to set the phone type as "Business Mobile"
    so it correctly populates in the GCIMS and works for 2FA.
  - You can learn more about using your phone for two-factor authentication in
    our [Slack]({% page "/tools/slack" %}), [GitHub]({% page "/github" %}), and
    [Gmail]({% page "/gmail" %}) guides. For two-factor authentication with
    these applications, you can use SMS, [Authy](https://www.authy.com/), or
    [Google Authenticator](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447?hl=en).

- **Only use Apple's default Mail app to access your GSA email.** You must
  [generate an App Password](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en)
  in your Google account to use with your Mail app, instead of your normal email
  password.

### Tips

- **[You should tether to your laptop to the iPhone](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204023)**
  for internet access when you're on the go.

* If you can't send email with your new work iPhone, create a new email and
  check the From field. If it's a jumble of letters and numbers
  `@secure.mass360.com`, tap on it to change it to your `@gsa.gov` email
  address. Then go **Settings > Mail > Default Account > GSA Account** to switch
  the default address.
* If you stop getting email on your phone and can't log into your account,
  [contact the Service
  Desk]({% page "/getting-started/classes/gsa-internal-tools/#it-service-desk" %}).
* To reduce waste, GSA IT will
  [disable mobile service for inactive accounts](https://insite.gsa.gov/portal/content/663074).
  The consumed minutes is the metric used to determine activity, so if you only
  use the phone for data, you'll still need to make an occasional call on your
  mobile phone to prevent the account from going inactive.
* If you need help with your phone, [contact the GSA IT Service
  Desk]({% page "/getting-started/classes/gsa-internal-tools/#it-service-desk" %}).
* For information on which mobile phones are available on GSA's current
  contract, employee discounts, voicemail setup, commonly used apps to install,
  mobile security, traveling with your smartphone, the GSA smartphone
  replacement process, and more, see
  [Mobile Devices](https://insite.gsa.gov/employee-resources/information-technology/do-it-yourself-self-help/mobile-devices-phones-tablets).

## Software

See the [software]({% page "/software/" %}) page.

## Peripherals

Upon request and subject to availability, GSA IT will provide peripheral
equipment to any GSA employees who requests it. To request peripheral equipment,
please submit an
[IT ticket](https://gsa.servicenowservices.com/sp?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=4c1a24391b1349107adac808624bcb50&sysparm_category=0d89b52fdb1e33400dc9ff621f9619a5)
for a remote workers home kit. The kit typically includes: a monitor, keyboard,
mouse, headset, and hub to provide additional connectivity.

Please note, GSA IT does not provide wireless peripherals. Wireless peripherals
can be purchased by the business unit, but only upon TTS leadership approval.

If your business unit is willing to pay for peripherals beyond what is included
as part of GSA's remote workers home kit, you will need to submit a
[micropurchase request]({% page "/purchase-requests/" %}) which will be reviewed
by a TTS purchase card holder. Please note that you will need to make a copy of
this
[Section 889 Open Market Justification](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jRMwRi94_O_YJ_0JkvKtRhniitjU2ZMFggXRirL6eOE/edit#heading=h.mw15bdywiu3d),
fill it out, and attach the link to the micropurchase request form.

In order to obtain standard issued hardware, the requestor must contact the IT
Service Desk or open a [ServiceNow ticket](https://gsa.servicenowservices.com/).
For non-standard IT equipment, requestors must complete and submit an
[Exception Waiver](https://insite.gsa.gov/employee-resources/information-technology/it-assistance-and-help-desk/service-catalog/exception-waiver-request-process-for-nonstandard-equipment-and-macintosh?term=exception%20waiver)
for review and approval.

### Printers

A separate justification process is required for printer requests. If you
believe you have a business justification for a home printer, please discuss
with your supervisor. This request will require approval from your supervisor
and the head of your division. To submit a waiver for a printer, please complete
a
[Non-Standard Equipment Request](https://gsa.servicenowservices.com/sp?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=ed419ee8dbd2e7000dc9ff621f9619c6)
via the GSA IT Service Desk.

If you need to setup a printer while in the office, follow the instructions
[here](https://insite.gsa.gov/employee-resources/information-technology/do-it-yourself-self-help/telework-technology?term=printer%20driver#Print).

## Equipment to accommodate disability

GSA provides equipment to accommodate an injury or disability under these
conditions:

- You have supporting medical documentation for the need for a certain piece of
  equipment.
- You only need the equipment to do your work.

To purchase this type of equipment, attach a doctor's note. If you have
questions, ask in {% slack_channel "equipment" %} or
[tts-equipment@gsa.gov](mailto:tts-equipment@gsa.gov).
[More information.](https://insite.gsa.gov/topics/information-technology/508-accessibility/center-for-information-technology-assistance-cita)

## Repairs

For issues with any GSA-provided hardware (such as laptops or phones), [contact
the GSA IT Service
Desk]({% page "/getting-started/classes/gsa-internal-tools/#it-service-desk" %}).
If you have a GSA-issued MacBook, please note that in your IT ticket.

If your ticket gets stuck, follow [the escalation
instructions]({% page "/getting-started/classes/gsa-internal-tools/#it-service-desk" %}).
