title: RFC 004 - Cross-TTS Hiring at Scale
date_approved: 2021-08-03
---

## The problem / situation / context

The pace at which TTS has hired staff is no longer sustainable, as we are
growing the organization and are called on to help implement aspects of the
administration’s top priorities, including the American Rescue Plan. We can only
accomplish the goals set out before us if we rapidly hire at scale. We have
limited TTS Talent, OHRM, and hiring manager / interviewer capacity. **TTS will
pilot cross-TTS hiring: the goal is to hire faster while attracting a highly
qualified, diverse candidate pool.**

With our new Direct Hiring Authority approval in place, we are piloting a new
approach to hiring through March 31, 2022. We assembled working groups from
across TTS to draft cross-TTS position descriptions and specialized experience
statements for four discipline areas: Account Management / Project Coordinators,
Design/CX, Engineering, and Product Management / Program Management.

With integrated position descriptions, we need only one HR action and public
notice on USAJobs per discipline area across TTS. This reduces the effort to
prepare and post these public notices.

Once position descriptions are complete, teams can begin efforts to source
diverse candidate pools. TTS Talent is already utilizing job boards and events
to reach diverse pools of talent.

TTS Talent will encourage all candidates to attend cross-TTS information
sessions to learn about opportunities with the relevant TTS groups and about the
application process.

What happens after candidates apply? How will TTS coordinate? How will
candidates be evaluated? How do we preserve candidate experience? How do we
preserve equity and inclusion throughout the process?

## The proposed path forward

I propose the following:

1. In addition to the efforts mentioned above to attract diverse candidates,
   Talent will work to incorporate equity, and inclusion in the process.
   Everyone conducting interviews will participate in
   [interviewer training](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1IvFawhU2lUPIQexUgCgCcRgxjaD5D9BGnRJYkAyM3JY/edit#slide=id.g6d9ab3b2cf_0_404)
   that covers unconscious bias. Talent will work with hiring teams on best
   practices regarding equity & inclusion in our evaluation of candidates, our
   selection of interview panels, and how we conduct interviews / take notes,
   debrief, and make selections.
2. Candidates will apply without indicating specific TTS group(s) of interest.
   Hiring managers will review all resumes and select candidates of interest.
   Some offices may be interested in the same candidates. Talent will then do a
   review of all selected candidates to ensure that they meet the specialized
   experience requirements. Talent will then reach out individually to the
   qualified candidates to discuss the offices considering them and to ask if
   the candidate wants to proceed.
   1. Rationale:
      - For Hiring managers: Some of our TTS programs aren’t as well-known as
        others. We want to ensure each office has an opportunity to identify and
        interview candidates.
      - For Talent: There is significant Talent effort required for each
        candidate pool. Given that there are 7 TTS BUs participating in some of
        these hiring actions and that we have very limited resources, managing
        multiple pools of candidates isn’t feasible.
      - For candidates – People will have an opportunity to learn about offices
        / opportunities they might not have considered during the application
        process.
3. We’ll cap the number of people a hiring manager can select to interview based
   on the number of hires they’re trying to make. Talent will look at the
   conversion rates of recent hiring actions to inform their recommended number
   per hiring manager. If the hiring manager is unable to hire enough qualified
   candidates from that initial pool, they can select a second pool of
   candidates.
   1. Rationale: This will limit the burden on everyone participating in hiring.
4. We’ll consolidate the number of interviews from 4 to 3. Traditionally offices
   have done a phone screen, technical, core values, and behavioral based
   interview.
   1. Rationale: Phone screens have traditionally been used to introduce
      candidates to the team and role they are interested in while also
      screening them for the basic skills needed to do the role. To replace the
      ‘introduction’ part of the phone screen, candidates will be given the
      optional opportunity to submit answers to some basic questions in their
      application including why they are interested in the opportunity/org.
      Hiring managers/interviewers will be provided this information in advance
      of their interviews to read. Talent will also run interview information
      sessions via Webex (so candidates will be anonymous) for candidates that
      have been selected to interview. The candidates will be provided with
      information on the interview process and what to expect and will be able
      to ask questions anonymously about the process to create a better
      candidate experience in lieu of the phone screen.
   - I’d like to see if we can effectively evaluate candidates while limiting
     the hours we spend interviewing and debriefing on each candidate. Given all
     the needs of the organization, our limited Talent resources, and the amount
     of time it takes to coordinate and schedule each interview, something has
     to give, and I’d like to give this a try.
5. Candidates will receive interview questions in advance.
   1. Rationale: We’ve gotten extremely positive feedback from candidates.
      Having the questions in advance helps people prepare, interviewers have
      noted that the answers candidates provide are better, and reduces some of
      the stress of the interview process for the candidate.
6. Technical interview: Each hiring manager will have discretion on how they
   conduct their technical interview. Candidates interested in multiple
   opportunities will do multiple technical interviews. If teams want to extend
   the technical interview from an hour to 75 minutes and start the meeting in
   what traditionally had been the “phone screen” to set the stage with the
   candidate and have a two-way dialogue, they can do that. (Or to allow
   additional time at the end of the interview for questions.)
   1. Rationale: The roles and responsibilities of each TTS BU are different and
      consolidating these technical interviews to work across TTS is not
      feasible.
7. The final two interviews will be a core values interview and a behavioral
   based interview (i.e. leadership, communication, problem solving, conflict
   resolution, etc). I’d like to stand-up a working group to determine the
   questions for these TTS-wide interviews. Experienced TTS interviewers will
   conduct these interviews on behalf of TTS. Interviews in core-values and
   behavioral-based interviews will have two or more interviewers participating.
   1. Rationale: The second and third interviews will be the non-technical
      interviews. Candidates interviewing for multiple TTS positions will only
      have to do these non-technical interviews once. Hiring managers will be
      able to share notes and talk to the interviewers. This helps preserve
      candidate experience; we shouldn’t expect candidates to do a separate core
      values interview for COE, Login, and 18F, for example. Experienced
      interviewers will conduct these interviews because they have a deep bench
      of experience evaluating candidate responses, specifically around core
      values and DEIA.
8. Reference checks, to be conducted by the hiring manager, are optional, but
   are _strongly encouraged_.
9. Selection. If more than one TTS office is interested in hiring the same
   candidate, the candidate will decide. If the candidate wishes to speak to
   other people in that organization before making a decision (which happens
   often), Talent or the Hiring Manager will facilitate scheduling those
   conversations.

We’ll evaluate this pilot after candidates have been selected from the first
cross-TTS hiring pool. We’ll hold a retrospective on the process including PD
drafting, sourcing strategies, interview process, and candidate selection.

We will consider the following metrics:

- [TTS demographic trends](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eYqMhVBRvjCjnJpq_51h_MgLcXZQNN8wacWQC9XdzMw/edit#gid=1850147999)
- Average time to hire one person compared to FY21 year-to-date data
- Number of people hired over 6 months period of time compared to past years
  data over a 6 months time period

## Alternatives considered

1. Posting individual roles as separate notices on USAJobs and allowing the
   candidates to self-select orgs of interest, as we have been doing. The
   drawbacks of this are: more effort to process resumes and schedule interviews
   for multiple teams; candidates might apply to multiple roles and we are
   running them through the similar interviews and having to track them in
   different spreadsheets; some BUs might get a smaller applicant pool; instead
   of outreach (sourcing, info sessions, job boards) for one role, Talent would
   have to do it multiple times for multiple roles.
2. Use consolidated cross-TTS postings and provide candidates the option to
   select orgs of interest. Make it each Hiring Manager’s responsibility to
   manage their own interview process; essentially removing Talent from the
   responsibilities of managing the interview and candidate experience process.
   The drawbacks of this are: candidates interested in multiple roles will have
   multiple (potentially duplicate) interviews; potential for loss of equity and
   fair evaluation; candidate experience would suffer; if TTS/OHRM hiring
   practices and guidelines are not followed, it could open TTS/GSA up to risks.

## Equity and Inclusion

Hiring for speed may have tradeoffs associated with it. I’m concerned that
moving faster may mean that the diversity of our candidate pools may suffer.
There is a lot that we (as an organization) can do to make sure that’s not the
case – teams can do sourcing for candidates and Talent will post to diversity
focused job boards, we will draft templates for social media posts, and Talent
can pair with TTS employees in “sourcing jams” where we do boolean searches for
key terms within your twitter or linkedin networks to identify candidates and
invite them to information sessions. I encourage all of you to start thinking
through your networks and identifying good folks that may be eligible for these
positions. If you have other ideas, I’m all ears.

## Premortem / Review

We will hold retrospectives after each cross-TTS hiring cohort and may adjust
this process regularly based on feedback and learnings.
