## The problem / situation / context

In May 2021, The White House issued an
[Executive Order on Improving the Nation's Cybersecurity](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/).
This EO outlined a few things to government agencies:

- Improving Policy
- Removing Barriers to Sharing Threat Information
- Modernizing Federal Government Cybersecurity
- Enhancing Software Supply Chain Security
- Establishing a Cyber Safety Review Board
- Standardizing the Federal Government’s Playbook for Responding to
  Cybersecurity Vulnerabilities and Incidents
- Improving Detection of Cybersecurity Vulnerabilities and Incidents on Federal
  Government Networks
- Improving the Federal Government’s Investigative and Remediation Capabilities

Technology Transformation Services (TTS) is/has been creating systems,
applications and programs that are at the forefront of technology in government
(e.g. [Cloud.gov](https://cloud.gov), [Login.gov](https://login.gov),
[USWDS](https://designsystem.digital.gov/)). However, TTS has limited expertise
in cybersecurity. With the aim for continued growth of TTS in FY22 (and beyond),
it is imperative that we grow the skills and expertise to support a clear,
unified direction for best practices and operations in cybersecurity.

## The proposed path forward

[RFC 002](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RedCM0NgQ3D5NmVZXqLZv5HTvNTb05SCqROkqJLd18s/edit)
received feedback from across GSA with agreement that we should invest in
security. One of the conclusions in this RFC was to create a TTS security lead
position to coordinate security approaches/activities across TTS programs.

**Proposed path forward: ADD a Senior Cybersecurity Advisor in the TTS Front
Office.**

From @mzia:

> Person should be skilled to understand compliance security and translating
> them into technological solutions for product teams and helping
> chart/strategize their way to a deliverable product. If the person’s knowledge
> is just dealing with compliance check-boxing and nothing along the lines of
> how it maps to modern tech and security practices or patterns to SDLC then
> it’s just not going to work. The opposite is true as well.

> The individual must be a strong communicator who also knows how to navigate
> the federal landscape and build working relationships within and outside of
> GSA, laser focused around cybersecurity.

### Why should we do this

Adding a Senior Cybersecurity Advisor to the TTS Front Office is beneficial for
the following reasons:

1. **Cybersecurity point of contact at TTS.** The Senior Cybersecurity Advisor
   will assist in bridging our communications throughout GSA in regards to
   security and privacy in our organization. For example, they will work with
   both the Information Security and Privacy Offices at GSA to continue the
   existing collaboration we have with these offices. This will not exclude the
   ability for individual teams to interact with these offices.
1. **Creates and delegates TTS-wide services that will enhance cybersecurity.**
   The Senior Cybersecurity Advisor will lead the effort in cybersecurity
   services and best practices that will create a better cybersecurity ecosystem
   at TTS, as well as ensuring teams have uninterrupted access to security and
   privacy tools and services they need.
1. **Collaborate and advise on cybersecurity hiring needs at TTS.** The Senior
   Cybersecurity Advisor will work transparently with TTS leadership, Talent and
   our various programs to determine any hiring and staffing needs for TTS. This
   will be in collaboration with our ISO and Privacy offices.
1. **Communicates and consults with various programs and guilds on
   cybersecurity.** Work closely with the TTS-wide program leads and the
   Security and Compliance Guild to continuously share information between
   programs and concerns and maintain a holistic view of the security needs of
   TTS.
1. **Identifies and shares cybersecurity training opportunities for TTS.**.
   Identifies opportunities for training within TTS, which could encompass
   career-track training for those interested, and broadly applicable training
   for the folks in the trenches, like incident response.

### Why shouldn't we do this

Having a single point of contact for cybersecurity could lead to bottlenecks in
all of the ways our organization is trying to move forward in cybersecurity
[mentioned above](#why-should-we-do-this). It will be important that this role
delegates and collaborates with others across GSA to ensure that the work is not
silo'd to a single person/group.

From @ryanhofdotgov:

> What I would hope to avoid is the anti-pattern we see at many of our partner
> agencies – medium-sized security teams at lower offices (in addition to larger
> ones at their top-level agency), with atrophied skills and unnecessarily
> divergent policies and practices.

It is important to note that there may be issues if this role is not provided
the budget and staff required to do this work. While the initial part of this
role will be to determine a budget, staff and hiring, a funding source for this
role should be identified. This will help to avoid any additional burden to
teams with any specific tasks this role may have for TTS programs.

## Alternatives considered

1. Current TTS Leadership, ISO + Privacy Office continues to collaborate on
   cybersecurity at TTS.
1. Each TTS program/team continues to perform their own cybersecurity direction,
   inline with their own SSPs and collaboration with the GSA ISO and Privacy
   Offices.

## Equity and Inclusion

It is imperative that this role should take equity and inclusion in to
consideration to ensure that candidates from all races, cultures and backgrounds
are taken in to account. There should also be direct  outreach and
recruiting to candidates within cybersecurity profession.

## Premortem / Review

This proposal is one of many other conclusions that came out of RFC 002:

- Get additional engineering (of all kinds, including security) and subject
  matter expertise into program teams where unique use cases exist
- Merge product teams (that are currently small) to create better coverage,
  particularly in terms of engineering, and also being able to justify a
  full-time security person
- Provide TTS-wide services that will enhance security via the proposed Delivery
  Team

These should also be taken in to consideration when reading through this RFC.
