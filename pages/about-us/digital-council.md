The Technology Transformation Service (TTS) Digital Council, formerly the
[Office of Programs and Products (OPP)]({% page "/solutions-history/" %}) Web
Council, was formed in August 2019. Then acting Assistant Commissioner for OPP,

## Guiding Principles 

### Value Customers

- Advocate for our customers (user-centric focus, data-driven decisions, apply
  best practices, etc.).
- Seek opportunities to improve our customers' experience.
- Prioritize work by its value to customers, its impact on business operations,
  and its value to management, in that order.

### Support GSA and Other Federal Agencies

- Support GSA implementation of laws and policies related to digital government
  and customer experience, including but not limited to:
  - 21st Century IDEA
    ([Public Law 115-336](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/5759/text)),
    including the website standards
  - OMB guidance (for example,
    [OMB A-11 Guidance](https://www.performance.gov/cx/assets/files/a11-280.pdf), Section
    280 - Managing Customer Experience and Improving Service Delivery)
- GSA orders and Office of Strategic Communication guidelines
- Align with GSA initiatives.
- Coordinate communications products with the GSA Office of Strategic
  Communication.
- Encourage agency-wide adoption of best practices championed by digital service
  teams across industry and government.
- Help colleagues across GSA and government.

### Support TTS

- Respect the role and authority of colleagues. For example, we:
  - Coordinate with the [TTS Technology
    Portfolio]({% page "/tech-operations/" %}) and the [TTS
    Outreach]({% page "/outreach/" %}) teams when updating domains or creating
    digital products.
  - Coordinate with the TTS Outreach team for message alignment and approval.
- Adhere to TTS communication guidelines.
- Support TTS business goals and objectives.
- Use and promote the use of TTS products and tools, where appropriate.

### Work Ethically

- Collaborate to improve our productivity and to create artifacts.
- Build upon best practices and avoid "reinvention."
- Respectfully and constructively address guidance or processes that we agree
  should be clarified or revised.
- Value ease and simplicity (design, development, strategy), and try to make the
  right thing the easy thing.
- Coordinate and organize around projects to avoid superficial barriers and
  silos.
- Respect and support other Council members.

- Ideally, each TTS team that manages or produces a TTS digital product (digital
  team) is represented on the Council.

  - Empowered to make content changes to the website/digital product (or see
    that they get made).
  - Knowledgeable about the workflows of the website/digital product.
  - Prepared to commit time and follow through on those commitments, expecting
    to be held accountable by Council members.

## Roles & Responsibilities

All Council members need to:

- Be responsive to data calls and other calls to action.
- Attend regular Council meetings, or have a backup designated to attend when
  they can't.
- Actively participate in Council discussions and projects.
- Inform their teams of Council activities, and solicit input from their teams
  as needed.

The Council has a coordinator and deputy coordinator. The coordinator is
appointed by TTS leadership. The deputy coordinator is selected by the
coordinator from among Council members willing to volunteer for this role. The
coordinator and deputy coordinator will:

- Schedule meetings.
- Create agendas.
- Oversee Council plans, projects, policies, reports, and other products.
- Coordinate with internal and external stakeholders.

  commitment.

## General Procedures

### Meetings

[Meeting agendas/notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Nt4EBHFVRtEfQ1h1eqkmpZ6nGQkMFYPVkKfMsXFVQLA/edit)

The TTS Digital Council meets weekly for an hour. Council members working on
projects and tasks expend additional time.

### Decision Making

The TTS Digital Council is an advisory body only. The Council can make decisions
about its own activities, while all other decisions still remain the purview of
TTS leadership.

Decisions are made by majority rule. Each digital team is allocated one vote. In
the event of a tie, the decision will be made by the Council's coordinator or
the executive sponsor.

### Working Groups

The Council convenes working groups for specific projects. Working groups are
established by decision of Council and disbanded at completion of a project.
Working groups will strive to standardize systems and create artifacts that can
be used across TTS (and potentially GSA and governmentwide).

## Deliverables

- Reports and action plans (for example, website modernization plans).
- Artifacts, such as guides, templates, policies, standardized processes.
- Research.
- Budget recommendations.

## Outcomes

- A digital-first TTS that sets the highest standard of customer experience for
  government.
- A more experienced TTS workforce that has learned by putting theory into
  practice.
- Partners who appreciate and recognize the value that TTS provides.
- Happy customers!
