title: TTS Consulting Handbook
---

The TTS Office of Consulting (TTSC) Handbook establishes standard operating procedures (SOPs) for 18F and the Centers of Excellence (CoE). It sets expectations for managing our consulting business, and delivering for our partners.

These SOPs are how we think we can best achieve our mission. If the majority of our work follows these paved roads, it will improve delivery quality, client satisfaction, employee engagement, and the overall organizational durability.

## Do 18F and CoE do everything the same way now?

No. We’re still blending two teams with different traditions and ways of working. On some matters, a standard approach for all TTSC operations and engagement delivery has been established. On others, 18F and Centers of Excellence still have different approaches. The TTSC Handbook acknowledges these differences when appropriate.

During the TTSC realignment, adjustments will be documented in this handbook on a rolling basis. In the meantime, consolidating the pre-existing guidance in one place is a step toward forming new ways of working together.

## Governance process for the TTSC Handbook

The TTSC Handbook should be considered the source of truth for any TTSC policy or procedure.

We need all staff to help keep the handbook up-to-date. If you find content that is incorrect, missing, or confusing, please [submit an issue](https://github.com/18F/handbook/issues/new).

The TTSC Chief of Staff is the handbook owner. They will review any suggested edits or additions on a rolling basis and direct a content review annually. All pages have a “Last modified date.”
