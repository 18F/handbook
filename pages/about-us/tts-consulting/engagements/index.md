title: Engagement overview
---

Our work with government partners is the primary way TTSC delivers on our mission. This work is how we help agencies modernize technology systems and build their staff’s capacity.

Historically, 18F has referred to this work as “projects” and CoE has called them “engagements.” As part of our realignment, we are standardizing this language:

- **Projects** are focused around addressing a specific service challenge or problem
- **Engagements** are generally a broader effort which can contain one or more projects

Both require deep alignment and support of the partner, and can be staffed with 18F people, CoE people, or a combination of the two.

Engagements for both 18F and CoE generally move through the same phases:

- [Set up](#set-up-phase-of-engagements)
- [Discovery](#discovery-phase-of-engagements)
- [Implementation](#implementation-phase-of-engagements)
- [Handover](#handover-phase-of-engagements)

Some notes on engagement phases:

- **All of these phases may or may not occur within the same agreement** with a partner. They may also be spread out over multiple agreements.

- **This is the most common pattern of phases.** However, engagements may need to run activities in a different order, or iterate back and forth between phases.

- **We balance project management, delivery, and capacity building throughout these phases** to meet the partner’s needs and achieve our mission.

- **The Implementation phase frequently includes some kind of acquisition** (either an assisted acquisition operated by TTS Consulting, or acquisition consulting with a partner’s acquisition folks). The sequence and duration of acquisition work depends on the needs of the partner. CoE tends to do the acquisition work right at the beginning of Implementation, while 18F typically does any acquisition work in parallel with the Implementation activities conducted by our fed team.

- **Depending on the phase and scope of your project, there are various standards for delivery and compliance** that your team needs to adhere to. When relevant to common activities, laws, regulations, standards, and/or best practices are highlighted.

## Set up {#set-up-phase-of-engagements}

In the set up phase, our goals are to:

- Understand the scope of problem (identify the organizational problem or need) and pitch how TTS Consulting can help
- Set expectations on the level of effort, team composition, and cost to our partners
- Establish a legal agreement to provide funding for a team
- Onboard the team and bring them up to speed on expectations set

To achieve these goals, we typically:

- Identify and qualify new engagements in business and partnership development {% comment %}TODO link to Partnerships and business development{% endcomment %}
- Establish productive relationships and partnerships {% comment %}TODO link to Managing the partner relationship{% endcomment %}
- Process agreements and SOWs {% comment %}TODO link to Agreements{% endcomment %}
- Prepare our partners to work with us {% comment %}TODO link to Preparing our partners to work with us{% endcomment %}
- Start tracking finances {% comment %}TODO link to Managing engagement finances{% endcomment %}
- Staff people to the engagement {% comment %}TODO link to Staffing engagements{% endcomment %}
- Kick off the engagement team {% comment %}TODO link to Kickoffs{% endcomment %}
  - Clarify roles and responsibilities in the team {% comment %}TODO link to Roles and responsibilities{% endcomment %}
  - Define the tools the team will use to work together {% comment %}TODO link to Tools for collaboration{% endcomment %}
- Start internal reporting{% comment %}TODO link to Project Management {% endcomment %}

We know we have been successful when:

- TTSC has the authority, funding, and staff to conduct an engagement
- The team can bill against inter-agency agreement (IAA)
- Partner and engagement team know the scope that was agreed upon

## Discovery {#discovery-phase-of-engagements}

In the discovery phase, our goals are to:

- Validate the problem or need with end users to reduce risk of failure in future phases
- Recommend a path forward for the partner to deliver on their problem

To achieve these goals, we frequently:

- Conduct desk and user research {% comment %}TODO link to Conducting research and synthesizing findings{% endcomment %}
- Synthesize findings and recommendations {% comment %}TODO link to Conducting research and synthesizing findings, Making recommendations{% endcomment %}
- Track progress and risks {% comment %}TODO link to Tracking progress and risks{% endcomment %}
- Create demos, presentations, and reports {% comment %}TODO link to Creating demos, preseations, and reports{% endcomment %}
- Manage blockers, escalations, and scope adjustments {% comment %}TODO link to Managing blockers, escalations, and adjustments{% endcomment %}
- Get and manage contractor support {% comment %}TODO link to Managing contractors{% endcomment %}

We know we have been successful when:

- Research validates the core problem or need (or the problem or need is shifted to match the research), and the partner understands and trusts the research performed
- The first slice of implementation is identified and validated, and the partner is aligned on this path
- An assessment of the organization’s maturity is conducted and the first slice of capacity building is identified
- Recommend who will deliver first slice of implementation — 18F team, industry partner, or other

## Implementation {#implementation-phase-of-engagements}

In the implementation phase, our goals are to:

- Build trust in the path forward by delivering on the first slice of work
- Continuously validate and correct the delivery path to de-risk overall effort
- Enable partner to continue the work after TTS Consulting departs

To achieve these goals, we frequently:

- Run an acquisition {% comment %}TODO link to Acqusitions{% endcomment %}
- Teach our partners skills to manage digital services {% comment %}TODO link to Teaching our partners{% endcomment %}
- Evaluate engagement impact {% comment %}TODO link to Evaluating engagement impact{% endcomment %}
- Develop and begin executing a transition plan {% comment %}TODO link to Planning for transition{% endcomment %}
- Build a website or software {% comment %}TODO link to Building products, websites, and software{% endcomment %}
- Launch a website or software {% comment %}TODO link to Launching products, websites, and software{% endcomment %}
- Advance larger modernization efforts {% comment %}TODO link to Advancing larger modernization efforts{% endcomment %}

We know we have been successful when:

- Functioning software, feature, or product is delivered to partner and end users
- Research validates what is delivered with end users
- Implemented software, feature, or product is released, deprecating previous system if applicable
- Partner capacity and capabilities increased through training, hiring, or other means
- The transition plan is clear and feasible

## Handover {#handover-phase-of-engagements}

In the handover phase, our goals are to:

- Reduce dependency on TTSC so partner can continue digital modernization work
- Prepare TTSC and partner to speak to the outcomes achieved
- Document and share what we have learned together

To achieve these goals, we:

- Develop talking points and share our work {% comment %}TODO link to Sharing our work{% endcomment %}
- Complete the transition to partner {% comment %}TODO link to Planning for transition{% endcomment %}
- Complete closeout tasks for the engagement {% comment %}TODO link to Closing an engagement or project{% endcomment %}

We know we have been successful when:

- Partner is fully operating product without TTSC support and tools
- Case studies, blog posts, or talking points are prepared for both TTSC and the partner to describe the outcomes achieved
- TTSC practices are updated based on lessons learned if applicable
- Engagement is administratively closed
