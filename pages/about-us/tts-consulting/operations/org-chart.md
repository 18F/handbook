  - Questions for the Leadership Team should typically go through your supervisor and/or director.
  - [18F leadership feedback form](https://forms.gle/BgUfv5pW3vWyt37S6) can be used to ask questions of the whole LT. Form submissions go to an 18F leadership shared folder, and email notification goes to one leadership member, who shares submissions with the group. If a name is submitted with the form, leadership will reach out to the person who submitted the form.
