title: Records management
---

A “record” is any information — stored in any physical or digital format — that documents the agency’s organization, decisions, functions, activities, and commitments.

At TTSC, records may include emails, contracts, presentations, reports, files in Google Drive, Slack posts, etc. Common records include:

- IAA agreements with partners
- Business development pipeline notes
- Roadmaps
- Decision-making frameworks
- Research plans
- Survey results
- Usability test results
- Meeting notes
- Retros
- Project health responses
- Prototypes

## Why does records management matter?

Records management is the law (specifically the Federal Records Act of 1950). GSA staff are required to make and preserve records.

Good records management helps us keep our commitments to partners and employees, make good decisions, show evidence of our organization’s impact, and comply with transparency mandates, such as FOIA requests.

For more information on records management policy and general guidance, please review the records management training in OLU.

## Who is responsible for records management?

All TTSC staff are responsible for records management.

On projects, AMs, PLs, and ELs are accountable for ensuring records for their projects are properly managed and archived.

For 18F, the 18F Folder is owned by the 18F Director and the Director of Operations.

For CoE, the CoE Drive is owned by CoE Front Office and CoE Management Team google groups are both owners.
