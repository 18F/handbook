## How should TTSC staff allocate our time?

TTSC employees are expected to bill a certain amount of hours towards assigned billable projects each week. TTSC does not penalize employees for lower utilization if they haven’t been assigned billable work.

Supervisors’ utilization expectations are based on the number of direct reports, detailed in the table below:

| Number of direct reports | Utilization % target | Target hours |
|--------------------------|----------------------|--------------|
| \>/=7 | 30% | 10-16 hours |
| 6 | 40% | 14-18 hours |
| 5 | 50% | 16-20 hours |
| 4 | 60% | 18-24 hours |
| 1-3 | 65% | 20-26 hours |
| 0 (individual contributors) | 80%+ | 32+ hours |

## What is billable? What is not billable?

Generally:

- **Billable time** = Work that enables engagement delivery
- **Nonbillable time** = Indirect work that does not provide direct value to engagement delivery

### Billable time

You must bill all time that is a direct cost to a project. This includes:

- Discipline-specific work for a project, i.e. Engineering, Design, Product, or Strategy work
- Project team meetings (stand-ups, grooming, planning, retro, and anything else\!)
- 1:1s with project team members
- Client meetings
- Travel to client meetings, as well as time spent arranging travel and getting reimbursement
- Time reading Slack channels about the project
- Time reading emails about a project
- Time thinking/brainstorming about project work, even if not in front of your computer
- Time talking about your project at team meetings, or publicly
- Time writing about your project on the blog
- Time onboarding to a project, which includes reading documentation and learning about the agency
- Time offboarding from a project. This includes postmortems, writing documentation, and organizing your working files so that other people could pick it up later and continue your work
- Business development and IAA work (for continuing projects only)
- Conferences, training and meetings that are in service of project work
- Coordinating staffing for projects with a signed IAA

Sometimes internal TTSC meetings provide direct value to your engagement and can be billed — for example, a discussion with your supervisor about a deliverable, attending a guild session where you learn tips for your current ATO process, or getting feedback in a critique group. Talk to your supervisor if you’re unsure if an activity is billable or not billable.

#### Billable TTSC Tock codes

We are in the process of consolidating nonbillable codes across TTSC, but for now please continue to use the appropriate codes for your team:

| Work type | CoE feds | 18F |
|-----------|----------|-----|
| **Work for a partner** by folks staffed to the engagement. | Ask EL | Ask AM |
| **Engagement support or deliverable review.** Use this code if you are not staffed to the engagement. | Ask EL | Ask AM |
| **Fully reimbursable details.** If a detail is not fully reimbursable, talk to leadership first. | ? | 1995 |
| **Helping TTS/GSA.** If you are asked to assist with any hiring or support activities outside of 18F/CoE, please talk to your supervisor. They can advise you on the proper code and billability. | Ask supervisor | Ask supervisor |

### Nonbillable time

{% alert %}
  Supervisors will review other non-billable circumstances and provide further guidance. Ask your supervisor if you are unclear what to bill.
{% endalert %}

You must not bill for the following activities because these are indirect costs and are not inherently valuable to any one single partner:

- Out of office (Award leave, sick leave, PTO)
- Conferences, trainings and meetings that are not in service of project work
- OLU trainings that are not in service of project work
- Internal organization meetings (Team Coffees, TTS Town Hall)
- Business development for new projects (on non-live projects – developing a continuation of work plan is okay to bill.)
- Hiring activities, including interviews, resume reviews, stand-ups
- Performance reviews
- New hire onboarding

## Frequently asked questions

### About Tock and time tracking

#### What is Tock and why do we use it?

Tock is a different tool than [HRLinks](https://hrlinks.gsa.gov/). Here is a quick comparison:

|  | Tock timesheet | HRLinks timesheet |
|--|----------------|-------------------|
| **Level** | TTS | GSA |
| **Cadence** | Weekly | Bi-weekly |
| **Goal** | Tracks how time is spent, so we bill partners appropriately | Tracks how much an employee is working, so we track leave appropriately |
| **Timesheet shows** | How time is spent within a given week (billable and nonbillable) | How much time was spent working within a pay period, and what kind of leave was taken (sick, annual, award, admin, etc.) |

#### Who is responsible for time tracking?

- **All TTSC employees** are expected to Tock weekly by COB (close of business) each Friday, and submit HRLinks timesheets every two weeks.
- **Supervisors** are responsible for checking hours logged by their direct reports in Tock, including billable and nonbillable time. They also approve HRLinks timesheets every two weeks.
- **AM/EL/EMTs** review and approve time billed to engagements on a monthly basis via the engagement Tock report.

#### How and when do I log my time in Tock?

The weekly time reporting period lasts one week, beginning on Sunday and ending on Saturday. You must review and submit your timecard each week by the end of the day (close of business) on Friday. When submitting your timecard, choose the correct week for your entries from the list on the homepage, adjust your Tock entry to reflect how you spent your time, and then submit your timesheet.

Failing to Tock on time prevents Operations from running financial reports and creates a lot of work for other people. Please make sure you Tock before you end your workday on Friday. If Friday is a holiday, then you’ll be expected to complete your timecard by the first workday following.

Timecards for the current week should be available no later than Monday at 9AM PST.

#### Where do I go for guidance on specific Tocking activity?

##### For billable engagement work

The AM/EL is your first point of contact regarding Tock guidance. If the activity is still in question or is not related to a specific engagement, escalate up to the supervisor, and then your director for further guidance.

If you ARE the AM/EL, go to your Supervisor.

##### For non-billable Work

Your supervisor is the first point of contact regarding Tock guidance on non-engagement work.

### Working more than 40 hours

#### Can I Tock more than 40 hours in a week?

We can’t work more than 40 total hours without being compensated for that time. Working overtime without prior approval violates the [Antideficiency Act](https://www.gao.gov/legal/appropriations-law/resources).

If you find yourself needing to work more than 40 hours, here are the steps to take *before* you work any extra hours.

{% alert %}
  If you have an established Alternate Work Schedule (AWS), your situation may be [slightly different](#how-does-aws-impact-how-i-tock?).
{% endalert %}

First, ensure you can work the extra hours:

1. Talk to your Engagement Lead, Account Manager or Project Lead **and** supervisor to figure out if and how much over 40 hours you can work.
    - The Engagement Lead, Account Manager, or Project Lead should inform leadership that overtime is necessary, so they can provide support and guidance as needed.
2. The Engagement Lead, Account Manager, or Project Lead must check and then adjust the engagement’s financial accounting.
3. The supervisor must approve the requested hours in [HRLinks](https://hrlinks.gsa.gov/). Generally, Compensatory Time (comp time) is the option likely to be approved. Overtime is generally not an option as it triggers increased compensation.
4. Get your supervisor’s approval in writing. Your Supervisor must justify the comp time upon submission of your timesheet in HRLinks.

Then, make sure to accurately track your overtime hours in Tock and HRLinks:

5. Request overtime in {% slack_channel "tock" %}. The Tock administrator will adjust the Tock setting to allow for 40+ hours to be recorded.
6. Work your week!
7. Log total hours in Tock.
8. Check that your approved extra hours have been properly accounted for prior to submitting your timesheet in HRLinks. Log total hours in HRLinks. This is where your comp time is recorded and where you’ll use it for future leave. In HRLinks, navigate to Request Absence/OT and make a comp time earned request for the extra hours you worked.

No matter how many hours you work, it is crucial that you accurately report those hours in Tock. Knowing the actual amount of time you work helps us better scope and estimate costs and rates.

#### How does AWS impact how I Tock? {#how-does-aws-impact-how-i-tock?}

Tock will limit you to 40 hours per week by default. Please request an alternative work schedule in {% slack_channel "tock" %} if you are on an AWS. You do not need to do this if you are on a flexible week schedule.

#### Can I ‘save’ billable hours to apply to a subsequent week?

No. Please don’t “save” hours or avoid billing for time you’ve worked in a given week. In addition to hurting our capacity to improve our engagement scoping assumptions, it is illegal not to bill for time spent working for partners.

There are several mechanisms and processes in place to make sure engagements don’t go over budget:

- We build a risk reserve within each engagement to ensure we have extra hours for needs that arise during the engagement.
- Engagement Leads closely monitor engagement burns on a weekly basis and communicate that to TTSC Leadership and Front Office.

In short, we need to know if our scoping is accurate and understand the cadence of work throughout an engagement. We’d rather be over budget and have our teams deliver value than be under budget and hide how many hours it truly takes to deliver on our engagements.

## How do I correct a prior Tock submission?

Submit a Tock change request using [the Tock Change Request form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe5RDFOlyWm0IXv7_eXjZ3CEjaGj2CmM-_TNgqwMjdspfQz7Q/viewform). You can also ping the Tock team in the {% slack_channel "tock" %} Slack channel. Make sure to inform your AM/EL with any submitted change requests.

## How do I log my time for upcoming leave?

If you are going to be out of the office for an extended period of time, head to the {% slack_channel "tock" %} channel in Slack before you leave and ask that the team submit your Tock hours for you during your out of office period.

Example:

> “I will be out of the office from Monday September 16th through Monday September 23rd: could you enter 40 hours for me to \#670 for the 16th-20th time period?”

## How do supervisors review hours logged in Tock?

Supervisors should regularly review the hours their direct reports are logging.

From the [View users](https://tock.18f.gov/employees/) tab in Tock, search the list of users lists of users, then click and open the report to review their recent Tocks. Check:

- Overall utilization rate
- Out of office time accounted for (including holidays and any administrative leave granted)
- Correct Tock lines (including details and extended out of office)
- Correct billable expectation

18F supervisors are expected to complete the [Weekly Supervisor Data Check](https://airtable.com/app1anoO5i5d3RJRA/pagYbQmUcGgPS4lEt/form).
