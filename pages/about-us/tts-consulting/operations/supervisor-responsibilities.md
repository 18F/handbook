---

Supervisor responsibilities are generally outlined in the [TTS New Supervisor Playbook]({% page "supervisor-resources/new-supervisor-playbook/" %}) and the [TTS Supervisors Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14bSqkCzfxvf5lI7k_LwSK8MLDnImqjrQFTXrtTcwcEY/edit#heading=h.5m4e2v6ntbj1). [Performance plans]({% page "about-us/tts-consulting/operations/performance/" %}) also lay out specific expectations for TTSC supervisors.

At a high-level, TTSC supervisors are expected to provide their direct reports with:

- Being a thought partner and reviewer for engagement work, ensuring the deliverables meet quality standards *and* advance the engagement goals
- Help completing administrative tasks
- Providing context on our organization and ways of working
- Collecting peer feedback and conducting performance reviews
- Supporting professional development

Supervisors are also expected to contribute to organizational initiatives and fulfill duties as assigned such as:

- Leading or supporting hiring activities
- Serving as a SME for business development and partnership calls and proposal development
- Facilitating the Delivery Assurance team (aka TLC Crew) and ensuring individual contributors not assigned to partner work are contributing to organizational initiatives productively
- Leading necessary working groups

TTSC supervisors are also responsible for regularly conducting the following administrative tasks:
