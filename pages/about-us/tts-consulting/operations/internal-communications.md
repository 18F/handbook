title: Internal communications
---

TTSC uses several practices and tools to support clear and frequent internal communication.

## Calendars

- [Google Calendar]({% page "tools/google-calendar" %}) is the primary way we indicate our availability and reserved time blocks.
- [The TTSC Calendar](https://airtable.com/appN6llr7h1vUry6P/pag1kYDFRwB6qUilp?cmpsj=allRecords) in Airtable includes both 18F and CoE events.
  - You can subscribe to a [feed](https://airtable.com/appN6llr7h1vUry6P/pag0aA4Lrc6QZta3Q) that brings these into your Google Calendar.
- [The Federal holidays calendar](https://airtable.com/appN6llr7h1vUry6P/pag0aA4Lrc6QZta3Q) from OPM is handy too.

## Google Groups

[Google Groups]({% page "tools/google-groups/" %}) are used as email aliases for groups such as chapters.

TTSC-specific groups of note:

- [All TTSC staff](https://groups.google.com/a/gsa.gov/g/TTS-Consulting-Team)
- [TTSC leadership](https://groups.google.com/a/gsa.gov/g/TTS-Consulting-Leadership)
- [All 18F staff](https://groups.google.com/a/gsa.gov/g/18f-team)
- [All CoE staff](https://groups.google.com/a/gsa.gov/g/coe-leads)
- [18F-dev@gsa.gov](https://groups.google.com/a/gsa.gov/forum/#!forum/18fdev)
  - All new engineering chapter members should be added by their supervisor. If for some reason you didn't get automatically added, give a shout in {% slack_channel "#dev" %} and someone there will get you set up.
- [18f-eng-leadership@gsa.gov](https://groups.google.com/a/gsa.gov/forum/#!forum/18f-eng-leadership)
  - This is a good way to write to the entire engineering leadership team at once.

## Slack

Slack is a primary communication space across TTS.

## Meetings

### Conduct and norms

See the handbook section on [interacting in meetings]({% page "about-us/tts-consulting/operations/conduct-and-norms/#interacting-in-meetings" %}).

### Scheduling meetings

When scheduling a meeting, include an agenda and a descriptive title. If an invitee‚Äôs attendance is optional, indicate this.

Aim to schedule meetings during the block of working hours shared across continental U.S. time zones. That block of time is:

- Eastern: 1 p.m‚Äì5 p.m.
- Central: 12 p.m.‚Äì4 p.m.
- Mountain: 11 a.m.‚Äì3 p.m
- Pacific: 10 a.m.‚Äì2 p.m.

### Meeting platforms

TTSC‚Äôs primary meeting platforms are [Google Meet]({% page "tools/google-meet/" %}) and [Zoom]({% page "tools/zoom/" %}) (generally for larger meetings). Engagement partners may use other platforms, such as Microsoft Teams: see [using partners‚Äô tools]({% page "general-information-and-resources/collaboration-tools/#using-partners-tools" %}).

### Recurring meetings

If you schedule recurring meetings for your engagement or other work, revisit them regularly and adjust their cadence and purpose as needed.
