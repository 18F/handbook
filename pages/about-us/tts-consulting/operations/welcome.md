Welcome to the Office of Technology Transformation Services Consulting (TTSC)! Weâ€™re so glad to have you! ðŸŽ‰

As you work through the onboarding checklist provided to you by TTS People Ops, we encourage you to ask lots of questions. Your onboarding buddy is a great resource, as are the TTSC portions of this handbook. Read through it as time allows, prioritizing these pages:

- [About this handbook]({% page "about-us/tts-consulting/about/handbook/" %})
- [About the TTS Office of Consulting]({% page "about-us/tts-consulting/about/mission/" %})
- [Compliance with laws and regulations]({% page "about-us/tts-consulting/operations/regulations/" %})
- [Conduct and norms]({% page "about-us/tts-consulting/operations/conduct-and-norms/" %})
- [Internal communications]({% page "about-us/tts-consulting/operations/internal-communications/" %})
- [Organizational financial management]({% page "about-us/tts-consulting/operations/finance/" %})
- [Engagement overview]({% page "about-us/tts-consulting/engagements/" %})

Other important things to know as a new employee:

- **Locations:** TTSC has staff spread across many time zones, states, and territories. Sometimes people meet in person at GSA offices in:
  - [Washington, DC (1800 F St NW)]({% page "washington-dc/" %})
  - [Chicago (Kluczynski Federal Building)]({% page "chicago/" %})
  - [San Francisco (United Nations Plaza)]({% page "san-francisco/" %})
  - [New York City (One World Trade Center)]({% page "new-york-city/" %})

- **Pronouns:** At TTSC, itâ€™s common for people to include their pronouns when introducing themselves, but itâ€™s not required.

- **Slack:** [Slack]({% page "tools/slack/" %}) is a primary communication space across TTS. 18F uses Slack extensively, whereas CoE has tended to use gChat a bit more. Talk to your team about their preferences. Using Slack at TTS is different from using Slack at other workplaces, so make sure to review the [Slack code of conduct]({% page "about-us/tts-consulting/operations/conduct-and-norms/#interacting-on-slack" %}).

- **Self-care:** The work we do is rewarding, but itâ€™s also challenging and demanding. Setting boundaries around your time and energy will be helpful as you begin to develop your work routine and habits.
  - Donâ€™t work more than 40 hours a week unless you have permission to do so. If youâ€™re unable to do everything you need to do within 40 hours a week, talk to your supervisor ASAP. {% comment %} TODO: Link "you have permission to do so" to the overtime Engagements finance section when it exists{% endcomment %}
  - Set up your workspace so that you can be comfortable and focused.
  - Plan time in your day for breaks, especially before your schedule starts to fill up with meeting invites.
  - Start building your support network. Use virtual coffees to build connections with your teammates, work through challenges, and celebrate wins.
  - Get familiar with the free [Employee Assistance Program (EAP)]({% page "getting-started/classes/benefits/#employee-assistance-program" %}). This benefit provides access to a variety of support services (financial, mental health, legal, and much more).
  - Consider a daily wind-down practice to help build a separation between work and your personal life.
  - Take leave as you need to. Please follow the [leave checklist]({% page "travel-and-leave/going-out-of-office/#checklist-for-going-out-of-office" %}).
