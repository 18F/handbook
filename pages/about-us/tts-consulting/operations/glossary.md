title: Terminology and glossaries
---

Acronyms and lingo abound in both government and technology. Here are some resources to help navigate the jargon:

- [18F's crowd-sourced glossary](https://github.com/18F/the-glossary/blob/main/glossary.md) (Tip: Type “@Charlie define” in many Slack channels and a bot will pull the definition from this list.)
- [CoE glossary](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Wy0yVoLXlmaNd6oJ0_onS-StoOsP1vgI_4_zWemO2TU/edit?usp=sharing)
- [TTS glossary](https://handbook.tts.gsa.gov/general-information-and-resources/glossary/) is not as exhaustive, but has links to other programs’ glossaries.
