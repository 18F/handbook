After onboarding, TTSC staff have various training obligations, some of which are mandatory. TTSC also encourages staff to seek out and take advantage of professional development opportunities each year.

## Mandatory training

TTS and GSA require employees to complete annual recertification on a variety of topics. Required courses are conducted through GSAâ€™s [Online University](https://gsaolu.gsa.gov/). See the [current list of mandatory trainings](https://insite.gsa.gov/employee-resources/training-and-development/mandatory-training).

Supervisors, CORs, and acquisition consultants may have additional mandatory training to complete.

## Other trainings

### TTS Consulting group trainings

Training themes across the organization are established annually. Staff work to bring in trainings to meet these needs. They are shared via email and Slack.
