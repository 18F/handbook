title: Operational initiatives and maintenance support
---

As a lean and learning organization, a variety of one-off tasks, special initiatives, and occasional maintenance chores bubble up all the time. Sometimes these tasks fit clearly within the scope of an existing staff role, other times they could be done by anyone with a bit of time.

Here are some of the mechanisms TTSC has to do this kind of work:

| Resource | Helps with |
|----------|------------|
| [**\#ttsc-help-wanted**](##ttsc-help-wanted-slack-channel)  | **Short, fast, billable or non-billable tasks**  like writing review, graphic design, general volunteers |
| **[Delivery Assurance (aka TLC)](#18f-delivery-assurance-\(aka-tlc-crew\))** | **Two week or less, non-billable tasks** like Facilitating project reflections, making updates or fixing bugs on 18F products,  |
| [**18F Working Groups**](#18f-working-groups)  | **A few hours a week for a few months** like Internal surveys and analysis, developing smart default templates, revising performance plans |
| [**TTS Operations support services**](#tts-operations-support-services)  | **Recurring TTS-level ops tasks or improvements**  like processing agreements, outreach approvals, hiring actions |

## \#ttsc-help-wanted Slack channel {##ttsc-help-wanted-slack-channel}

TTSC staff may request help from peers for a few hours of billable or non-billable work by posting to the {% slack_channel "ttsc-help-wanted Slack" %} channel.

If your task is specifically for writing/editing help, use `@writing-editors` to ping the content designer group.

If the task is for a partner project, Tock to the appropriate engagement code.

## 18F Delivery Assurance (aka TLC Crew) {#18f-delivery-assurance-(aka-tlc-crew)}

Between partner engagements, 18F staff provide operational and maintenance support to 18F products, processes, and teams. Individuals are temporarily staffed to “Delivery Assurance” which was nicknamed by staff “TLC Crew” because they are giving our organization and practices Tender Loving Care.

Assignments occur in two-week increments. Supervisors take turns managing the crew and a member of the 18F LT leads issue prioritization every increment.

TLC works on issues submitted through [the TLC repo](https://github.com/18F/TLC-crew/issues) or through connected repos for 18f.gsa.gov, 18F blog drafts, 18F Guides, and Tock. Common requests include leading project reflections, making updates or fixing bugs on 18F products, or supporting operational functions.

To submit a request for the TLC Crew, please use the issue [templates](https://github.com/18F/TLC-crew/issues/new/choose). If you need access to 18F’s GitHub, post your request in the Slack channel {% slack_channel "admins-github" %}. (Watch a [tutorial on how to use GitHub](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Kha6M0C2OC87x1zeXtFMKNrAbZZGJbkephbbBr7G_mw/edit?usp=sharing)).

Since there can be no guarantee that this team is staffed every two weeks, TLC can’t guarantee delivery on issues in their repository *until they've been prioritized and assigned*. Consult the [TLC Crew README](https://github.com/18F/TLC-crew) for details.

Billable work should always be prioritized over TLC’s non-billable tasks. Billable work should run through the BD pipeline and staffing process. {% comment %}TODO: link BD process to engagements section{% endcomment %}

## 18F working groups {#18f-working-groups}

Working groups typically start through GMT and include some supervisors. ICs may join working groups if it does not interfere with meeting billable expectations.

Working groups are best for tasks that need a few hours a week for several months and benefit from continuity in who is doing the work. Examples include: conducting pulse check surveys and analysis, developing smart default templates, revising performance plans, building out operational AirTable interfaces.

If you have an idea for a working group, talk to your supervisor.

## TTS Operations support services {#tts-operations-support-services}

The TTS Office of Operations is tasked with supporting business functions in the various TTS Delivery units including TTSC. They are organized into divisions including Acquisitions, Business Operations, Outreach & Marketing, Market Development & Partnerships, and Talent.

For help with hiring, HR, benefits, finances, agreements, travel, coaching, etc, follow these steps:

1. Consult the main TTS Handbook. It is the primary source of information about support services and operational functions managed at the TTS level, including Talent, Business Ops, People Ops, benefits, etc.
2. Ask your supervisor.
3. Reach out to your [support contact for TTS employees](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15glvq9UakKUN8XTRTa6gRkhBHm2whhQyAGmf8ibTtBs/edit) for the specific service.
