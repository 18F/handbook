title: Brand management
---

Brand management means presenting our organization consistently and professionally so that we can build and maintain a recognizable brand. A recognizable brand supports business and partnership development. {% comment %}TODO: Link "business and partnership development" to Engagements section.{% endcomment %}

It involves [our mission and values]({% page "about-us/tts-consulting/about/mission/" %}), and design elements that reflect them.

## Who does this work?

Everyone. If youâ€™re creating a report, presentation, or collateral on behalf of TTSC, 18F, or CoE, follow this guidance.
