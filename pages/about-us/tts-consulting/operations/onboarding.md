Onboarding is how a new employee gets the tools, access, and information they need to be effective team members.

In addition to the TTSC portions of the handbook, refer to:

- [18F onboarding resources folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1yYYwfUhPmWuC1-3EqKtpbiFiHzDwYQhz)
- [CoE Onboarding deck, May 2024](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13INHVwT6wrI_O_ct2qyVDj__dMrMbRYOF04w0z97kik/edit#slide=id.ge45d8b0279_0_0)

## Who onboards new staff?

During the onboarding process, a new staff member will interact with different people and organizations at the GSA, TTS, and TTSC level.

| Who | What they do |
|-----|--------------|
| **GSA’s Office of Human Resource Management (OHRM)** | Handles initial enrollment in benefits and systems, provides access to HRLinks and answers the new employee’s questions about benefits. <br><br> See the list of [HR support contacts]({% page "general-information-and-resources/employee-resources-policies/benefits-links/#human-resources-hr-contacts" %}).
| **TTS People Ops Onboarding Leads** | Provide access to TTS applications, tools, calendars, and accounts. Invite the new employee to TTS onboarding classes. <br><br> Check the Slack channel {% slack_channel "onboarding" %} for names of current leads.
| **Supervisor** | Facilitates onboarding to the individual’s chapter or center. Opens discussion of the new employee’s interests and growth plan.
| **Onboarding buddy** | Serves as the new employee’s first point of contact for day-to-day questions about their team culture and getting set up to work. Helps direct the new employee to the right resources for learning more.

## Guidance for supervisors

### Tasks to complete

Refer to [TTS Supervisors Guide to Onboarding a New Hire](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ow1VIwSzAGGzsBjGUZMlnLwK6kKTZWS_paGyIzfgpbE/edit#heading=h.iozraxctamx3) for instructions on what to do in the leadup to a new employee’s start date, and their first few days. See the [slides from November 2022](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Lb8wPH1FCXazhWmfvGGc-KSoVns9loCXbUh-H2ttWe0/edit#slide=id.g18e280a316a_0_832) for more context if needed.

The list below has additional tasks that supervisors should complete in their new employee’s following few weeks.

#### Within the first week

- Set up a recurring 1:1. [Sample 18F 1:1 template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tNTnuG4MHjLV-GFTkS1kfzzHCtrqcb9abfgetNfInkw/edit), and [TTS resource for 1:1 questions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WVysnJMkLNkmQakjKIxa_v47Ws1RNDh6-iCMG6CsZ4k/edit)
- Add the employee to the following:
  - Org charts
  - Standing chapter or center meetings
  - Org-wide listservs
  - Chapter or center listservs
  - [18F Dashboard](https://airtable.com/appsLLLryeqBK2V9d/tblI4exRaTqcoRdRZ/viweBV6PeZy8DjYbK?blocks=hide) or [CoE Engagement Tracker](https://airtable.com/appde6nxcyY2NVG4E/tblWc6oYuYa3TLngE/viwHYfeZUj2aiYWi9?blocks=hide)
  - Shared calendars
- Check that they [Tocked]({% page "tools/tock/" %}) correctly.
- Sync with their onboarding buddy.
- Email the OGE 450 team to notify them there is a new employee who will need to file. [Sample text for email](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19GiqrI9rmnwclgcPSQ4dx3rc0jXnCWa-Rr4sOq6oTNU/edit?tab=t.0).
- (For CoE) Reach out to EMT to make sure the team member is in all the relevant ops worksheets.
- (For CoE) Make sure the new employee has the correct supervisor in FAITAS.

#### Within the first two weeks

- Check that they submitted their timecard correctly.
- Make sure the new employee has a 1:1 meeting with their chapter or center director.
- (For 18F) reach out in {% slack_channel "18f-team-coffee-ideas" %} to find a time to welcome the new employee at Team Coffee. Prepare them to unmute and introduce themselves.

#### Within the first month

- Add a [performance plan]({% page "performance-management/" %}) to HR Links and review with the new employee. If you’re a first-time supervisor, you won’t be able to do this by cloning a plan from a previous report, so contact PeopleOps for help.
- Monitor the new employee’s progress through their onboarding checklist. Make sure they have completed all their [TTS onboarding classes]({% page "getting-started/classes/" %}).
- Coordinate shadowing opportunities for the new employee, such as sitting in on a project team’s ceremonies, observing presentations or research sessions, or following a colleague through a day’s meetings.

In addition, confirm that the new employee has attended:

- Their first TTS All Hands and TTS Consulting All Hands meetings
- Their first 18F Team Coffee or CoE All Hands meeting
- Introductory meetings with their staffing representative
- Virtual coffees — suggest specific people for the new employee to meet

#### In the first year

- TTS will remind you to do a check-in with the new employee six months after their start date.
- You’ll be asked if the new employee should continue past their probationary period. If you don't answer, they will continue past the [probationary period](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/hiring-information/practical-tips-for-supervisors-of-probationers/).
- You’ll also get an email about their [Within-Grade Increase (WGI)](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/pay-administration/fact-sheets/within-grade-increases/) after their first year, which increases their pay through a step increase. If you do not respond, the WGI will proceed.

### Topics to discuss in the first two weeks

The outline below suggests topics to cover with new employees in their first two weeks—but you will need to tailor this content to individual employees. Be mindful of the stress of starting a new role and avoid overwhelming new employees with too much information all at once.

#### Who you are

  - Support personal development

#### Who they are

- Get to know the new employee and what might help them succeed in their first project Consider:
  - Their work experience and roles they feel comfortable with
  - Their interest in certain types of projects or policy areas
- Coordinate with staffing to match these preferences to incoming work

#### TTSC structure and roles

- Explain the different layers of the organization: GSA > FAS > TTS > TTSC > 18F or CoE.
  - Suggest correspondence codes as a way to place individuals within the reporting structure.

- Offer to demonstrate how to use Tock, what Tock entries can look like with time off or multiple projects, and how to submit a change request.
- Link them to the [GSA payroll calendars](https://www.gsa.gov/buying-selling/purchasing-programs/shared-services/payroll-shared-services/payroll-calendars) so they know when they will get their first paycheck.

#### Taking leave

- Explain that requesting leave happens through HRLinks. Offer to demonstrate.
- Emphasize that the new employee should take time off as needed. (“You do not need to ‘prove yourself’ to take time off here. It will not reflect poorly on you if you take time off within your first couple months.”)
- Refer to this [overview of leave types]({% page "travel-and-leave/leave/" %}) in the TTS Handbook and [additional information about how to take different kinds of leave](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-dm0tptMsZ2FKhuta52RFEiN4Sfkd9coYN0_tjQCe9Y/edit#gid=0).

#### Emergency contacts

- Get the person’s emergency contact information and add it to your work phone. Per the [18F Crisis and emergency support guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WcnPOXttX_EteHtyrPK6KDhFMHNGG2bVNB_EzYqfm-k/edit#heading=h.30epgryt0eaj), we want everyone to provide emergency contact information to their supervisor and keep it up to date.
- Encourage the new employee to share your or another staff member’s contact information with a loved one in case of emergency.

## Guidance for onboarding buddies

Onboarding buddies are one of the first points of contact for a new employee at TTS. Here are some resources to help you in the role of onboarding buddy:

- [TTS Onboarding Buddies Overview](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rO4TRcqYM-j70cHC1y8Vabfwp9TWwp5WFF7BraSUxLk/edit#heading=h.87p1j88vrkez) explains what the role is and is not and what an onboarding buddy does.
- [\[MAKE A COPY\] TTS Onboarding Buddy Checklist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JPcm7QE6eF5Y82DGRl4DUMMlBza26FPxmkq3fybum5U/edit#gid=238273324) outlines all the tasks an onboarding buddy should do before and after the new employee arrives. Make a copy for yourself.
- [How to be a great CoE onboarding buddy!](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12ykZHVH5O182dN7Hm6-6C9z-H3seKGZzDzaUqqo0OxI/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.4oq35vyptb97) provides additional suggestions for onboarding buddies. Some portions of this document may be out of date.
- Refer to the [handbook section on time tracking]({% page "about-us/tts-consulting/operations/tock/" %}) for instructions on how to bill your time as an onboarding buddy.
- Relevant Slack channels for onboarding buddies include:
  - {% slack_channel "wg-onboarding" %}
  - {% slack_channel "18f-wg-onboarding" %}
  - {% slack_channel "newemployees-[startdate]" %}: This is the new employee’s cohort channel, which a TTS onboarding lead will create and invite them to join. Onboarding buddies can also join this channel.

### How to be a great onboarding buddy

Beyond completing the tasks outlined in the TTS overview and checklist, your goal as an onboarding buddy is to be an approachable and trusted person for a new employee to ask questions, learn about culture and practices, and get help navigating their new workplace.

Keep these principles in mind:

#### Be available and responsive

- Proactively schedule check-ins with the new employee. Make time throughout the first month to chat, listen, and answer questions (when you can).
- Try to respond promptly to Slack messages. If you’re busy, let them know.
- Keep an eye on their onboarding checklist (you should receive a copy from TTS Onboarding) to check in on their progress. Offer to review items with them.
- Offer to pair with them on administrative tasks, like doing Tock or submitting their first timesheet, and on reviewing key documents, like the org chart.

#### Help the new employee find answers and solve problems

- Invite the new employee to come to you as a starting point for questions. If you don’t know the answer to a question, it’s OK to redirect them to their supervisor, especially for personnel-related issues like benefits and HR.
- Help them find answers by putting them in touch with the appropriate person or Slack channel.
  - Model how to search for information (for example, in Slack).
  - Model how to ask questions in the appropriate channels.
  - Encourage them to refer to the TTSC Handbook.

#### Introduce them to TTSC people, culture, and practices

- Offer a personal spin on culture and practices by talking about your favorite TTS, 18F, and CoE stories, folklore, and customs.
- Contextualize information they’re getting in the first couple weeks. If a meeting includes a lot of acronyms or topics that require a lot of background, message them to help explain.
- Help reinforce information in the moment. (For example, during the TTSC All Hands, remind them that #townhall typically has backchannel conversation).
- Encourage the new employee to build their support network from the start.
  - Explain the practice of scheduling virtual coffees/teas. Emphasize that people happily accept coffee invites. Give recommendations of people you think they should meet or offer to make connections. Introduce them to [coffee bingo](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gmPfTYBx29ySJY2b5MOzX392UREDpSPvyh7k53oSI6I/edit)!
  - Acknowledge that people have different levels of energy for social interactions.
- Give them a tour of the Slack channels you belong to and that they might want to join.
- Based on their interests, point them to [specific guilds to attend or working groups and initiatives]({% page "training-and-development/working-groups-and-guilds-101/" %}) to get involved in. Talk about how you built your own network.

#### Be personal and candid

- Get to know them! (As far as you’re both comfortable, ask about their personal lives and interests.)
- Keep your camera on during video calls to give them more connection
- Share your experiences:
  - Offer suggestions and reflections from your own onboarding experience.
  - Tell them about the projects you’ve been on, how you’ve worked with other disciplines, and what you’ve learned .
  - Offer opportunities to shadow your current project, or look for opportunities for them to shadow other team members.
- Talk about imposter syndrome, and model that it’s OK to discuss this openly.
- Ask questions that make space for candid feedback. (“What is overwhelming or confusing? Are you busy? Are you looking for something to do?”)
