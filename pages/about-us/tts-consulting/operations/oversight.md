## Tracking operational data in AirTable

TTSC uses AirTable to manage a variety of data about our operational “engine” including our staff, our engagements, and our resources.

### Key AirTable interfaces

- **[TTSC combined base](https://airtable.com/appFD087Gd8jhztYz?ao=cmVjZW50)**
  - Viewing data about 18F and CoE operations together. This is new and still in development.
- **[TTSC calendar](https://airtable.com/appN6llr7h1vUry6P/pag1kYDFRwB6qUilp?cmpsj=allRecords)**
   - Staff to see TTSC events, organizational milestones, etc. — you can [subscribe to a feed that brings these into your Google Calendar](https://airtable.com/appN6llr7h1vUry6P/pag0aA4Lrc6QZta3Q).
- **[18F Resource Library](https://airtable.com/appkBrEBVTMd9M5VC/pagyCKyWNdrBCgvP1)**
