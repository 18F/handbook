At TTS, [our mission]({% page "/tts-history/" %}) is to design and deliver a
digital government with and for the American public.

To ensure that the products we build and services we offer truly serve everyone,
we center our work on diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility (also
known as DEIA).

In particular, we align our efforts with recent Executive Orders on
[DEIA in the federal workforce](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/06/25/executive-order-on-diversity-equity-inclusion-and-accessibility-in-the-federal-workforce/)
and
[advancing racial equity through government services](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/20/executive-order-advancing-racial-equity-and-support-for-underserved-communities-through-the-federal-government/).

## Our approach to DEIA

We believe that diversity is vital to a successful organization and that we must
reflect the diversity of the public we serve. We also believe in transforming
our strategies to meaningful action and have outlined our DEIA initiatives here.

### Diversity

_Our definition_: Diversity is the presence of different identities,
perspectives, and experiences. Does our team reflect the diversity of our
country?

_Our efforts_:

- Internally publishing
  [demographic data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/1eYqMhVBRvjCjnJpq_51h_MgLcXZQNN8wacWQC9XdzMw/edit)
  on a quarterly basis. For those outside of TTS,
  [FedScope](https://www.fedscope.opm.gov/) is the most detailed public-facing
  website for federal employee demographic data.
- Partnering with organizations that focus on recruitment and hiring for
  underrepresented groups.
- Supporting all employees to join an [affinity
  group]({% page "/training-and-development/working-groups-and-guilds-101/" %})
  and/or create new groups. Our affinity groups are spaces where employees of
  similar identities come together in community.
- Coordinating with GSA’s Senior Advisor for Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and
  Accessibility who provides oversight and professional advice to TTS
  leadership, guilds and affinity groups.
- Investing in DEIA with dedicated funding and support for employees who work on
  DEIA-focused internal projects. In FY23, there will be a $500,000 DEIA budget.

### Equity

_Our definition_: Equity implores us to examine the impacts of the structures
and systems that govern our policies, processes, and decision-making. Are
outcomes and opportunities different, depending on someone’s identities?

_Our efforts_:

- Holding quarterly feedback sessions between affinity groups and the TTS
  Executive Director.
- Providing [unconscious bias training]({% page "/getting-started/classes/" %})
  to all new employees during onboarding.
- Leading regular [information sessions](https://join.tts.gsa.gov/) for
  candidates that focus on demystifying the federal hiring process.
- Reviewing interview guides for bias.
- Training hiring managers and interviewers on how to identify and reduce bias.
- Sending interview questions to candidates ahead of time.

### Inclusion

_Our definition_: Inclusion and belonging focus on our workplace environment. Do
our colleagues feel included, valued, welcomed, and respected?

_Our efforts_:

- Conducting an annual Inclusion and Belonging Survey.
- Delivering a [DEIA onboarding class]({% page "/getting-started/classes/" %})
  to all new employees.
- Writing content and building products externally which follow
  [inclusive language principles](https://content-guide.18f.gov/our-style/inclusive-language/).
- Maintaining an [Inclusion
  Bot]({% page "/general-information-and-resources/inclusion-bot/" %}) that
  nudges Slack users about exclusionary language and hurtful phrases.
- Maintaining a [list of inclusive
  behaviors]({% page "/general-information-and-resources/inclusive-behaviors/" %})
  and a [list of
  resources]({% page "/general-information-and-resources/deia-resources/" %}) to
  help our employees understand and advance DEIA through their work.

### Accessibility

_Our definition_: Accessibility focuses on access to tools and capabilities that
foster equal and full participation. Does everyone in our organization have what
they need to fully engage? Can everyone in the public use the products and
services we deliver?

_Our examples_:

- Training for best practices and manual testing, along with developing and
  procuring accessible software, supporting the
  [Section 508](https://www.section508.gov/content/about-us) team and their
  responsibilities.
- Maintaining an
  [Accessibility for Teams guide](https://accessibility.digital.gov/), equipping
  people across disciplines with the skills needed to successfully run an
  accessibility audit.
- Sharing our learnings by publishing
  [writing guides](https://accessibility.18f.gov/),
  [holding talks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CL6lOwJEMGQ),
  [writing blogs](https://digital.gov/2015/06/05/using-section-508-guidance-to-improve-the-accessibility-of-government-services/),
  and speaking at conferences.
- Ensuring our products and services satisfy all the
  [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/)
  (WCAG) 2.0 AA. We offer a
  [checklist](https://accessibility.18f.gov/checklist/) to make sure we’re
  meeting all the guidelines.
- Promoting inclusive design by including people of all abilities in user
  experience testing. This means adopting a “Solve for one, extend to many”
  methodology.
- Ensuring all new supervisors meet with our GSA reasonable accommodation
  coordinator.

## How we learn

As an organization, TTS is committed to learning from its DEIA efforts. We
strive to collect and publish data, and use these results to reflect honestly
and critically about our progress. We have a number of channels through which we
regularly collect feedback from employees.

- The Inclusion and Belonging Survey: In 2019, the Diversity Guild released the
  first-ever TTS Inclusion and Belonging survey as a benchmark for measuring how
  TTS is doing in the areas of diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging. The
  responses inform the work of the Diversity Guild, both in guiding TTS-wide
  action items and in planning weekly Guild Office Hours. View results from
  [2019](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11acPBMr02thj8f9SIcvO9iqlzBff-MCTG8C3dL7LFqs/edit),
  [2020](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Hhha6qPCCogu0UiufYJZ5YuhaRIfHK8zAFeeUgE1bR4/edit#),
  and
  [2021](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1tETeRLOydDLhMHFl1e2A5BzNhdWB9wxt4cH-yW1Qw0o/edit#).
- Affinity Groups Listening Tour: We work with TTS affinity groups to understand
  colleagues’ unique experiences, perspectives, expertise, and needs, and
  advocate for visibility, sponsorship, and accountability with leaders across
  our organization. The TTS Executive Director and the Diversity Guild Co-Leads
  hold quarterly listening sessions with each Affinity Group. Guild Co-Leads
  work with senior leadership, Talent, our People Ops team, and other internal
  partners to map feedback into meaningful action.
- [Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey](https://www.opm.gov/fevs/): The Office of
  Personnel Management (OPM) sends an annual, quantitative survey to federal
  employees across the government.

## DEIA Guilds

TTS has two
[Guilds]({% page "/training-and-development/working-groups-and-guilds-101/#guilds-in-tts" %})
that support our DEIA efforts: Diversity Guild and Accessibility Guild.

### Diversity Guild

Founded in 2014, the Diversity Guild advances TTS’s diversity, equity, and
inclusion goals. Its purpose is to help make TTS a great place to work for
people of all backgrounds.

#### Getting involved

There are a number of ways you can get involved or support the Guild’s
grassroots DEIA efforts.

1. Attend Guild programming: The Diversity Guild Co-Leads host weekly sessions
   (“Office Hours) focused on a variety of DEIA topics. Office Hours are held
   every Friday at 12:30-1pm EST. The meetings show up on the
   [TTS Working Groups and Guilds Calendar](https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=gsa.gov_o1aqcv28k1f0nmca5bkch8los4%40group.calendar.google.com).
   If you would like to be added to the invites directly, message one of the
   [Diversity Guild
   Co-Leads]({% page "/training-and-development/working-groups-and-guilds-101/#current-guilds" %}).
2. Join the (Slack) conversation. TTSers regularly share articles, ask
   questions, and celebrate milestones via the {% slack_channel "g-diversity" %}
   Slack channel. To promote a healthy and respectful environment, there are
   [special guidelines for #g-diversity](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IP0GERswH8t5nQxH0VyYPidj5TrkNtfJEmaPz3_y-go/edit).
3. Reach out with questions: the [Diversity Guild
   Co-Leads]({% page "/training-and-development/working-groups-and-guilds-101/#current-guilds" %})
   are available to chat with you.
4. Become a DEI representative (Rep): These are volunteers across TTS that help
   teams create a diverse, equitable, inclusive, and welcoming TTS. While
   everyone on a team has a responsibility to advocate for diversity, equity,
   and inclusion, the DEI rep role is to make sure that DEI concerns are always
   on the table for their team. And, they use their team-specific knowledge to
   inform Guild efforts and initiatives which are typically focused
   organization-wide. TTS staff can become DEI reps by reaching out to their
   team lead, current DEIA rep, or the Diversity Guild leads. For more
   information, see the
   [DEIA rep internal listing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g7bpwFBfpHMy0guu5nUaF0HhBLvu42pF0nCiBdb92M4/edit).

### Accessibility Guild

Our Accessibility Guild aims to empower TTS staff to center accessibility in
their work. In particular, this guild’s mission is to help TTS procure and
develop accessible products to provide an excellent user experience for
everyone. This includes thinking about accessibility in every step of a project:
vendor management and procurement, inclusive usability testing, universal design
principles in visual design and prototypes and software engineering best
practices. The guild provides training and awareness to make accessibility
everyone’s responsibility.

For more information, see the [Accessibility Handbook
page]({% page "/accessibility/" %}),
[Accessibility Guide](https://accessibility.18f.gov/), or join the
{% slack_channel "g-accessibility" %} Slack channel.

## Affinity Groups

Affinity groups are spaces where employees of similar identities can talk freely
amongst themselves. Depending on the group, it may be open or invite-only. Visit
the [affinity groups, working groups, guilds, and other communities Handbook
page]({% page "/training-and-development/working-groups-and-guilds-101/" %}) for
more information.
