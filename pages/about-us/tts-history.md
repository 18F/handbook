**Mission:** Design and deliver a digital government with and for the American
public.

**Vision:** Trusted modern government experiences for all.

## Our history

The roots of the Technology Transformation Services reach back to 1966 and a
nationwide network of 26 Federal Information Centers that people could visit in
person for answers to government questions. Over the next four decades, those
information centers would add numerous responsibilities and change names a
number of times before becoming the [Office of
Solutions]({% page "/office-of-solutions/" %}).

While OPP was paving the way for government shared services and open data, there
was a growing need to bring new technology talent into the government. In 2012,
the White House created the
[Presidential Innovation Fellows (PIF)](https://presidentialinnovationfellows.gov/)
program to bring technologists in for short tours of duty in government. The
next year, the PIF program found a permanent home at GSA and a group of PIFs
started thinking about how they could extend their impact on government. In
December 2013, eight PIFs left the fellowship to become GSA employees and
created a lean startup inside government.

That project became [18F](https://18f.gsa.gov/) when the office officially
launched in March 2014. 18F quickly grew in size to help federal agencies work
on technology projects while learning new skills. In 2016, 18F, PIF, and OPP
came together under the newly-formed Technology Transformation Service office.
In 2017, TTS added the
[IT Modernization Centers of Excellence (CoEs)](https://coe.gsa.gov/) to focus
on whole-agency technology modernization, and all of TTS moved into GSA’s
existing Federal Acquisition Service.

## TTS Today

TTS is part of GSA's Federal Acquisition Service (FAS) and contains several
offices:

- **18F** provides digital development and consulting services for any
  government agency or program, with a focus on cultural transformation and
  empowerment of the agencies they work with. A critical part of 18F’s mission
  is to teach agencies new digital skills during projects so that the agencies
  can take over continued development.
- **Solutions** helps agencies improve delivery of information and services to
  the public. Responsible for operations, evolution, and scaling of mature
  products and services such as USA.gov, Data.gov, Challenge.gov and the Digital
  Analytics Program.
- **The Centers of Excellence (CoEs)** implements IT modernization at federal
  agencies by leveraging private sector innovation and government services while
  centralizing best practices and expertise for holistic transformation.
- **Presidential Innovation Fellows (PIF)** is a fellowship that embeds
  talented, diverse technologists and innovators within federal agencies as
  yearlong entrepreneurs in residence. Together with agency leaders, PIFs
  improve the way our government designs, develops, and delivers services for
  the public.
- **The TTS Acquisition Division** drives smarter technology procurement through
  technical procurement consultations, new procurement vehicle creation, and the
  development of experimental procurement platforms and methodologies.
