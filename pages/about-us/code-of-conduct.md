## Introduction

TTS is committed to building a safe, welcoming, harassment-free culture for
everyone. We do not merely want a work environment that is free from hostility;
we want one that is actively welcoming and inclusive. We want our team and our
workplace culture to reflect and celebrate the diversity of the communities we
serve.

This Code of Conduct summarizes federal anti-harassment law and General Services
Administration policy. We intend the plain-language approach to promote a
culture of inclusion and respect.

We expect everyone on the TTS team to exhibit these behaviors and abide by
applicable federal laws and GSA policies. In addition, we expect everyone within
TTS spaces to exhibit these behaviors and refrain from behavior prohibited by
anti-harassment laws and GSA policies on harassment. These spaces include:

- TTS&#39;s physical offices,
- TTS events and meetings,
- All of our online forums and virtual collaboration tools, including:
  - Office chat rooms, like Slack
  - Mailing lists and email
  - Code repositories, like GitHub
  - Emoji, avatars, and other expressive reactions

## What We Strive For

We strive to create a welcoming and inclusive culture that empowers people to
provide outstanding public service. That kind of atmosphere requires an open
exchange of ideas balanced by thoughtful guidelines. If we have only openness,
colleagues who are on the receiving end of thoughtless or intentionally hurtful
comments and behavior may reasonably withdraw. If we have overly intrusive
guidelines, people may feel unwelcome.

It would be impossible to list everything staff can do to create a more
welcoming space, and we know this team will find ways to include their
colleagues that we haven&#39;t even thought of. But when in doubt, we encourage
you to look to these principles for guidance:

- Practice empathy and humility.
- Assume competence in your colleagues, clients and the public.
- Assume that everyone we work with is doing their best work for the public.
- Listen carefully and actively.
- Ask questions, and seek to understand your partners&#39; context.
- Encourage other people to listen as much as they speak.
- Treat other people&#39;s identities and cultures with respect. Make an effort
  to say people&#39;s names correctly and refer to them by their stated
  pronouns.

## Unacceptable Behavior

To help colleagues understand the kinds of behaviors that are illegal or run
counter to the culture we seek to foster, we&#39;ve listed below actions that
violate federal law and GSA policy. We&#39;ve also included steps to take if you
encounter behavior that runs contrary to this policy.

### Sexual and Non-Sexual Harassment

The [GSA Policy Statement on Sexual and Non-Sexual Harassment](https://www.gsa.gov/directives/files?file=2023-08/CC047930_%20directive_ADM%202325.8A,%20GSA%20Policy%20Statement%20on%20Harassment.pdf)
 forbids:

- Sexual and non-sexual harassment and misconduct
- Unwelcome verbal or written comment or physical conduct based on:
  - race,
  - religion,
  - color,
  - sex (with or without sexual conduct and including pregnancy and sexual
    orientation involving transgender status/gender identity, and
    sex-stereotyping)
  - national origin,
  - age,
  - disability,
  - genetic information,
  - sexual orientation,
  - gender identity,
  - parental status,
  - marital status,
  - or political affiliation.
- Retaliating against anyone who files a formal complaint that someone has
  violated GSA anti-harassment policies.

### Conduct Unbecoming a Federal Employee

Federal employees can be subject to appropriate discipline, up to and including
removal, for conduct unbecoming a federal employee, which is conduct which is
unattractive; unsuitable; detracting from one&#39;s character or reputation; or
creates an unfavorable impression. Abusive and demeaning remarks to and about
others in the workplace, and sexual remarks, which do not rise to the level of
sexual harassment under the employment discrimination laws, nonetheless can be
considered conduct unbecoming a federal employee.

### Other Unacceptable Behavior

In addition, the following behaviors violate applicable laws and policies, or
otherwise undermine the culture of respect and inclusion we seek to build within
TTS:

- Touching people without their affirmative consent.
- Sustained disruption of meetings, talks, or discussions, including chat rooms.
- Mocking someone&#39;s real or perceived accent or first language.
- Repeatedly interrupting or talking over other people in meetings and
  discussions.
- Negative or offensive remarks based on gender expression, mental illness,
  socioeconomic status or background, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance,
  or body size.
- Using emoji or creation of custom emoji for unacceptable behavior.

## Reporting violations

GSA's [Policy Statement on Sexual and Non-Sexual Harassment](https://www.gsa.gov/directives/files?file=2023-08%2FCC047930_%20directive_ADM%202325.8A%2C%20GSA%20Policy%20Statement%20on%20Harassment.pdf) and GSA's [Anti-Harassment Procedures in the Workplace](https://www.gsa.gov/directives/files?file=2023-12%2FCC044442_Order_HRM%209700.6%20CHGE%202%20Anti-Harassment%20Procedures%20in%20the%20Workplace%20%284%29.pdf) describe processes for reporting violations. Depending on your complaint, you may have a 45-day
window from the date of the incident to report it to GSA. Please read the documents carefully.

The behaviors listed in this section undermine the culture of inclusion and
respect that we are trying to build within TTS. We encourage you to report
violations to your supervisor, any management official, a Human Resources
official, and/or the Office of Civil Rights, so that TTS can take any necessary
steps to ensure that we have a safe and welcoming team.
