STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE: TC-18-CS1-001

|---|---| |**TO:**|GSA TTS, Office of Acquisition| |**FROM:**|Esther
Praske<br>Acting Director, GSA TTS OA| |**DATE:**|Iterated (3.0) on December 14,
2018| |**SUBJECT:**|Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for GSA TTS OA management
reviews of procurement actions|

_FAS TTS OA aims to redefine the culture of government acquisition of
information technology by bringing agile practices to government procurement and
related service level policy. One of the principles of agile is to embrace
change in a way that promotes continuous improvement. In keeping with this
principle, this SOP is subject to change to keep TTS procurement practices
current, applicable and in compliance at the Federal, Agency and Service levels.
TTS OA will accomplish this by soliciting feedback in quarterly iterations and
updating this SOP accordingly._

**1.0 Purpose:** The purpose of SOP TC-18-CS1-001 is to help ensure compliance
with all applicable acquisition laws and regulations and to improve the quality
of TTS procurements.

- **Iteration 1.1 Purpose:** Add timeframe for review process and clarify
  management level.

- **Iteration 1.2 Purpose:** Change notification of sensitive acquisition from
  prior to award to prior to public/external communications.

- **Iteration 1.3 Purpose:** Add process for notification of FBO actions to
  management and update OGP review process.

**2.0 Applicability:** This SOP applies only to TTS OA procurement actions over
the micro-purchase threshold (see
[Federal Acquisition Regulation [FAR] Subpart 2.101](https://www.acquisition.gov/content/part-2-definitions-words-and-terms#i1125359))
that will be executed by warranted Contracting Officers (COs) within the TTS OA.
Note that there are additional reviews required by Office of General Counsel
(OGC), Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), General Services Administration
Acquisition Manual (GSAM), and/or GSA acquisition guidance that are not
addressed here but must be followed.

**3.0 Background:** On November 2, 2017, the FAS Commissioner re-delegated
limited
[Procurement Authority](https://drive.google.com/a/gsa.gov/file/d/1-P5KyFuv-XpoSgbOwQywSgZOJTJXYxnB/view?usp=sharing)
to TTS. One condition of that authority was for TTS to develop a process to
review procurement actions to ensure compliance with applicable policies and
regulations.

**4.0 Procedure for management reviews:** The following is the process for
management reviews of procurement actions that TTS OA executes with its own
authority:

- **4.1 Management review process for TTS OA procurement actions**

  - **For procurements between micro-purchase threshold and $25,000:**

    - Prior to RFQ/solicitation release and prior to award, both TTS management
      (one level above the CO) and a TTS procurement analyst will review
      acquisition packages.
    - Acquisition packages should include, but not be limited to, the following
      items, as applicable to the procurement phase:
      - Market research report
      - Acquisition plan
      - IGCE
      - Any justifications or determinations and findings
      - Solicitation/Request for Quotation (RFQ)
      - Trade-off analysis
      - Award decision memo

  - **For procurements above $25,000:**
    - TTS management (one level above the CO) and TTS procurement analysts will
      perform the first review of acquisition packages prior to RFQ/solicitation
      release and prior to award.
    - At The Office of Governmentwide Policy (OGP)'s request, they may conduct
      additional reviews at any stage in the procurement process.
    - See above for examples of acquisition package documents to be reviewed.

- **4.2 Forum:** The forum for each review will be at the discretion of the TTS
  OA Contracting Officer (CO) and may include, but will not necessarily be
  limited to, a formal briefing, an informal meeting, or a “paper” review. The
  TTS OA CO is responsible for scheduling the review and forwarding the
  necessary documents to all reviewers via email 5 business days prior to the
  scheduled review.

- **4.3 Documentation:** The TTS OA CO is responsible for addressing and
  documenting significant comments received during the reviews using their best
  business judgment. The goal is to document the CO’s rationale for accepting or
  rejecting **significant<sup>1</sup>** review comments and to demonstrate that
  they meaningfully considered this feedback. The level of documentation is at
  the CO’s discretion; however, documentation of reviews will include, at a
  minimum, the following:

  - Project name/Contracting Officer name
  - Review type/date (e.g., “1st OGP review on 10/12/2017”)
  - Documents reviewed
  - Significant comments
  - CO reconciliation

Documentation of each review shall be filed under `Tab 025` in the contract
file.

**5.0 Notification of sensitive acquisition:** The TTS OA CO will notify the
Director of TTS OA and the TTS HCA of any actions considered “sensitive” at
least 15 calendar days prior to public/external communications. The TTS HCA
will, in turn, notify the FAS Commissioner (as necessary) of the action(s), per
the existing FAS Front Office contract notification procedures, at least 10
calendar days ahead of public/external communications. Examples of “sensitive”
actions are as follows:

- Acquisitions followed closely by media and industry
- High-visibility / Congressional Interest acquisitions
- Acquisitions related to government-wide or shared-services programs
- Acquisitions related to the launch of a new program
- Acquisitions that have received a GAO protest

**6.0 Notification of FedBizOpps (FBO) postings:** The TTS OA CO will notify the
TTS OA Director two weeks prior of any action posted on FBO (RFI, RFQ, etc.) via
the Weekly Report Fact Sheet Template.
