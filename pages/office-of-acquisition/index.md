Welcome to TTS Office of Acquisition (OA) team page!

## Our mission

Buy technology products and services for TTS and our partners in an effective
and efficient way.

## Who we are

We are a group of 1102 Contracting Officers, Procurement Analysts and
acquisition support professionals that procure IT products and services for your
teams. Here is a link to our
[org chart](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1YQr18Najc9_IKlJnrhA-3pEIrkMinri0nivvatMRbmk/edit#slide=id.g5d7a537eb8_0_0)
to learn more about us.

## What we offer

TTS Office of Acquisition (OA) is uniquely focused on helping government buy
modern digital technologies for internal and external clients. We specialize in
procuring Software as a Service (SaaS), Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS),
Platform as a Service (PaaS), and IT professional services.

If you are interested in learning more about which existing TTS vehicles you can
use, please see the
[OA TTS Wide Contract Vehicles](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SfgL5tOh0ez-dT4VTSO7e3q-x8oAgWcYXnbqOA9M7zQ/edit#gid=0).

## Clients

### TTS internal procurement

We buy IT products/services for TTS offices such as Clients & Markets,
Solutions, and Business Operations. If you are within TTS and your procurement
need costs less than $10,000, please visit the [Purchase
Requests]({% page "/purchase-requests/" %}) section in the handbook.

If you are within TTS and your procurement need costs more than the
micro-purchase threshold ($10,000), please visit the [Procurement over
$10k]({% page "/procurements-over-10000/" %}) section in the handbook.

### TTS assisted acquisition

In partnership with 18F, we procure modern, digital technologies for TTS’
partner agencies. Procurement of services and/or products over $10k that will
partially or fully support your partner(s) outside of TTS (including other GSA
offices and partner agencies), paid partially or fully by your partner(s), will
be considered an assisted acquisition.

However, OA is currently set up as a shared service, so please keep in mind that
we cannot work directly with outside partners. In order for us to do an assisted
acquisition, the request must come through one of the following TTS Business
Units (BU). Also note that each BU has its own assisted acquisition process as
well as vetting criteria. Please contact the following BUs for more information
and/or to get started:

- [18F](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1RIxGEtQ4vMEfcdx8JYXQ_U5-uTMTu1Ffi-UNur1XKHQ/edit#slide=id.p) -
  Inquiries18F@gsa.gov
- OPP - Slack {% slack_channel "solutions" %}
- [CoE](https://coe.gsa.gov/) - ConnectCoE@gsa.gov

## How we work

- We strive to procure technology in a transparent and cost-effective way. We
  collaborate directly with our internal clients to create the acquisition
  strategy and build the acquisition package together. We focus on procurements
  under $10 million to prevent vendor lock-in. We use low dollar amounts and
  option periods so that we can assess the results of our acquisitions, and
  refine our approaches over time to find the best value solution.
- In the spirit of innovation, we continue to experiment with new, collaborative
  ways of doing procurement while adhering to the various regulations and
  policies governing our work.

## FAQs

### What is a COR?

The Contracting Officer’s Representative (COR) helps the Contracting Officer
(CO) administer and manage the contract from time of award through the contract
close-out (or until you no longer serve in the role of COR, and in this case,
you will help with the transition of a new COR).

### How do I become certified as a COR?

The Federal Acquisition Certification for Contracting Officer’s Representatives
(FAC-COR) contains three levels of certification that allows for appropriate
training and experience for CORs managing a range of various contracts from
low-risk to high-risk and complex acquisitions.

CORs: Review
[FAC-COR Requirements](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HzbEv6yQn6pWYl1MDImeLW6ShedcRsekSCBe54Nsnc8/edit#heading=h.aizxbe137goh)
for education, experience, training requirements for each FAC-COR level. Refer
to
[FAITAS Frequently Asked Questions](https://drive.google.com/file/d/185q29ESV_h8zj4U2UscdH0rVxoSGnpSJ/view)
to learn how to apply for training. If you have questions, please Slack
{% slack_channel "fac-cor" %} and tag @michellepet, TTS-Bureau Certification
Manager for further assistance.

### I’ve taken the FAC-COR training and received a COR designation letter, now what?

for more information about being a COR.

page]({% page "/purchase-requests/" %}) to find out the process for services and
miscellaneous micropurchases and the [Software under $10,000
page]({% page "/software/" %})for software purchases.

the [Procurements over $10,000 handbook
page]({% page "/procurements-over-10000/" %}) to learn how to get started.
