Government requirements for shipping projects fall into the following
categories:

- Information Collection
  - [Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (PRA)](#paperwork-reduction-act)
  - Privacy Act of of 1974
  - E-Government Act of 2002
- Accessibility
  - [Section 508 Amendment to the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (508)](#508-accessibility)
- FISMA
  - One of the goals of the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002
    (FISMA) is to “provide a comprehensive framework for ensuring the
    effectiveness of information security controls over information resources
    that support Federal operations and assets.” The National Institute of
    Standards and Technology (NIST) was tasked with designing and implementing
    this framework: the result is NIST’s Risk Management Framework (RMF). All
    federal information and information systems (except classified information
    and national security systems) are subject to NIST’s RMF.
  - There's
    [an introduction to the RMF on NIST's website](http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SMA/fisma/framework.html).
  - A more comprehensive guide, including how to apply the framework, references
    to the various relevant publications, and definitions of roles and
    responsibilities, is found in NIST's
    [Special Publication 800-37](http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-37r1.pdf).
