## ATOs

[Learn about ATOs](https://atos.open-control.org/){.usa-button}

### Timeline

ATO Sprints are staffed cross-divisionally by the GSA Office of the Chief
Information Security Officer (OCISO) and TTS.

There are a few factors that will determine how long it takes a project to get
an ATO. These map to
[the checklist](https://github.com/18F/tts-tech-portfolio/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/ato.md),
so might be helpful to open that up in another window and follow along.

- Everything in
  [Phase 1](https://github.com/18F/tts-tech-portfolio/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/ato.md#phase-1-ato-sprint-prerequisites)
  needs to be done before the project can enter the ATO Sprint. That
  responsibility is on the project team and the respective Infrastructure Lead.
  Completing Phase 1 could take 40 hours of work.
- Your Infrastructure Lead conducts the documentation review of
  [Phase 2](https://github.com/18F/tts-tech-portfolio/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/ato.md#phase-2-documentation-review).
  Projects are scheduled for
  [Phase 3](https://github.com/18F/tts-tech-portfolio/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/ato.md#phase-3-ato-sprint)
  by the Infrastructure Leads as a group.
- [Phase 3](https://github.com/18F/tts-tech-portfolio/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/ato.md#phase-3-ato-sprint)
  should take two weeks, assuming the previous Phases were done thoroughly.

**The ATO Sprinting Team makes no _guarantees_ regarding the timeline of ATOs.**

### Steps

Once you have
[validated the path to production](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14nCznE0ofUxrQL50EokkLOS2_UPQyor7-W9OHjXH2XY/edit),
see this TTS-specific information beyond the
[**general steps**](https://atos.open-control.org/steps/):

#### Step 0

As soon as you begin developing an alpha,
[create your ATO checklist](#ato-checklist) to set up a tracking mechanism for
your ATO. You can ask questions in your checklist thread to understand the
specific considerations for your system. At this time it is also good to ensure
your system is eligible for [pre-assessment](#conditions-for-pre-assessment)
authorization for user testing purposes.

#### Step 1

Work with your Infrastructure Lead to [categorize](#system-categorization) your
system's impact levels, using the
[ATO Levels](https://atos.open-control.org/categorization/) guide. GSA provides
a "lightweight" ATO process designed for pilot systems running on GSA authorized
infrastructure, for which fewer controls are in scope.

#### Step 2

[General info](https://atos.open-control.org/steps/#step-2-select-security-controls)

#### Step 3

[General info](https://atos.open-control.org/steps/#step-3-implement-security-controls)

Work together with your Infrastructure Lead on this step. The documentation
generated by similar TTS projects can be helpful at this stage. Consult the
checklist for examples. SSP templates are available for both GSA LATOs and
FedRAMP ATOs.

#### Step 4

[General info](https://atos.open-control.org/steps/#step-4-assess-security-controls)

The first step in doing so is to run the [security
scans]({% page "/launching-software/security/#scanning" %}). This is a
preliminary assessment, final assessment will be done in collaboration with GSA
OCISO. You are encouraged to run scans yourself, so that there aren't big
surprises during the ATO Sprint.

In parallel, you will collaborate with a GSA OCISO assessor to verify all the
controls in the SSP. The exact tests are given by this
[assessment case template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xYv9PHk6P1ePHSQcJWXSAYbAvmxzSsDOZrdS285DKYY/edit?ts=58eba80c#gid=1541480683).

Your Infrastructure Lead will work with you to schedule and prioritize your
system assessment. Once assessment starts, the first step is that the AO will
review all the items in your ATO checklist including all the documents you
generated.

Then, for most systems, a team with members from the project team, your AO, your
Infrastructure Lead, and the GSA OCISO will convene for at least a week and
begin to follow the
[Lightweight Security Authorization Guide](https://insite.gsa.gov/topics/information-technology/security-and-privacy/it-security/it-security-procedural-guides).

Folks from OCISO will conduct a penetration test on the system. Any penetration
test findings deemed serious enough to prevent an ATO will need to be fixed
right away to unblock the ATO process. They will also review the SSP document
and test the control narratives. This testing and review process will take 1-2
weeks and should be the top priority for the project team at the time.

#### Step 5

[General info](https://atos.open-control.org/steps/#step-5-authorize-information-system)

#### Step 6

[General info](https://atos.open-control.org/steps/#step-6-monitor-security-controls)

There are several ways to ensure that your system remains compliant:

- Act on any security notifications from your [static
  analysis]({% page "/launching-software/security/#static-analysis" %}).
- Perform and act on findings from [dynamic
  scanning]({% page "/launching-software/security/#dynamic-scanning" %}).
- [Re-certify your Privacy Threshold Analysis
  (PTA).]({% page "/launching-software/privacy/#re-certification" %})

### Re-authorization

Beyond the
[**general information**](https://atos.open-control.org/overview/#re-authorization):

If you're planning a change that you think may require re-authorization, please
[open an issue in the TTS Tech Portfolio repository](https://github.com/18F/tts-tech-portfolio/issues/new?title=ATO+re-authorization+for+%3Cproject%3E?)
to explain your planned change, so they can evaluate it.

If your systems needs re-authorization, follow the usual steps for getting an
ATO, starting with [the checklist](#ato-checklist). You should be able to reuse
most of your existing ATO materials, assuming they have been kept up-to-date.

### ATO renewal

Beyond the
[**general information**](https://atos.open-control.org/overview/#ato-renewal),
follow the usual steps for getting an ATO, starting with
[the checklist](#ato-checklist).

## ATO Checklist

[Create your ATO checklist](https://github.com/18F/tts-tech-portfolio/issues/new?template=ato.md&title=ATO+for+%5Bsystem%5D+-+due+%5Bdate%5D){.usa-button}

([preview](https://github.com/18F/tts-tech-portfolio/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/ato.md#readme))

The ATO checklist helps you track progress towards a successful launch
throughout your project. It is a formatted issue on GitHub, and is the canonical
source of information for your path to launch.

Make sure to replace the placeholders (the things in `[square brackets]`). Feel
free to add a username after each task to assign it, and/or make corresponding
items in your issue tracker. Unless otherwise specified, all tasks are the
responsibility of the project team.

You are welcome to ask any questions as comments in the issue or
{% slack_channel "infrastructure" %}.

## Types of ATO

There are several different methods in obtaining a GSA Authorization as
described in the policy IT Security Procedural Guide: Managing Enterprise Risk
CIO-IT Security-06-30 in
[Insite](https://insite.gsa.gov/cdnstatic/insite/Managing_Enterprise_Risk_%5BCIO_IT_Security_06-30_Rev_16%5D_10-03-2019docx.pdf)

- GSA Standard A&A Process
- Lightweight Security Authorization Process
- GSA Salesforce Platform Process
- Security Reviews for Low Impact Software as a Service Process
- FedRAMP Process
- GSA Moderate Impact Software as a Service (MiSaaS) Security Authorization
  Process
- GSA Subsystem Process
- GSA Information System Continuous Monitoring Program

In most cases, the types of ATO that will be pursued for TTS custom software
systems are the _GSA Lightweight ATO (LATO)_. The GSA LATO process is described
in a guide on
[Insite](https://insite.gsa.gov/topics/information-technology/security-and-privacy/it-security/it-security-procedural-guides)
(search for "Lightweight Security Authorization Guide" on that page). Systems
that are under development must fulfill the requirements for
[pre-assessment for internal government use](#conditions-for-pre-assessment).

## System categorization

[General info](https://atos.open-control.org/steps/#step-1-categorize-information-system)

The GSA LATO is designed for **Low** and **Moderate** _impact_
[level](https://atos.open-control.org/categorization/) systems built using agile
methods that run on top of cloud infrastructure which has already received an
ATO (such as AWS, Azure, and [cloud.gov](https://cloud.gov)).

## Control selection

The GSA LATO is "lightweight" because it represents a tailored subset of the
hundreds of controls in NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-53.

## System authorization

The GSA LATO **Low** _risk_ system ATOs are valid for 3 years. he GSA LATO
**Moderate** _risk_ system ATOs are valid for 1 year. The Authorizing Official
(AO) and Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) may sometimes grant a 90-day
ATO, on a case by case basis. The default expectation is to avoid 90-day ATOs
whenever possible, since they make more work for everyone.

### Conditions for pre-assessment

_Previously known as "pre-authorization"._

First, read
[GSA's guidelines for staging sites](https://insite.gsa.gov/employee-resources/communications/digital-website-communication/policies-and-guidelines/guidelines-for-gsas-digital-presence/digital-presence-guidelines-security).

You may operate without further authorization, based on our approved
pre-existing security authorization, if all of the following conditions are met:

- The system is deployed to [cloud.gov](https://cloud.gov) or
  [TTS-managed infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS)](https://before-you-ship.18f.gov/infrastructure/#infrastructure-as-a-service-iaas).
- The system does _not_:
  - interact with or change the state of any production Federal information
    system, whether it is operated by TTS or our Federal partners
  - collect or store any sensitive [personally identifiable information
    (PII)]({% page "/launching-software/privacy/" %})
  - is not the canonical source of any "production" data
- The system is _only_ available to:
  - staff of the General Services Administration
  - other Federal staff / agencies, by one of:
    - IP CIDR block
    - some kind of auth mechanism
      - HTTP Basic Auth (one set of credentials shared amonst the team is fine)
      - OAuth
        ([cloud.gov authentication](https://docs.cloud.gov/apps/leveraging-authentication/),
        or [GitHub authentication](https://developer.github.com/v3/oauth/)
        limited to a particular organization)
      - etc.

For systems where _all_ of the information in the system is already publicly
available and is non-confidential, the last step can be skipped once you have
begun your ATO assessment with GSA IT.

## System Security Plan

As described in
[the NIST guide](http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-18-Rev1/sp800-18-Rev1-final.pdf#page=7):

> The purpose of the system security plan is to provide an overview of the
> security requirements of the system and describe the controls in place or
> planned for meeting those requirements.

At TTS, the system security plan (SSP) is a long Google Doc.

- [Visio]({% page "/18f/chapters/design/#drawing-lines-on-a-screen" %})

## FedRAMP packages

Often you'll be building on top of services that have FedRAMP authorizations.
When writing your SSP, you'll need to mark certain controls as "inherited",
based on the Customer Responsibility Matrices (CRMs) of the Cloud Service
Providers (CSPs).

- For cloud.gov, you can download the CRM from
  [their website](https://cloud.gov/docs/overview/fedramp-tracker/#how-you-can-use-this-p-ato).
- For others, you'll need to
  [put in a package request](https://app.docusign.com/templates/details/434e60cc-fbd1-4708-9373-aef41439ff05).

## RSA Archer

[RSA Archer](https://www.rsa.com/en-us/products/integrated-risk-management) is
the canonical home for system compliance info at GSA. System Owners and
Authorizing Officials should automatically have access, but additional read-only
access can be
[requested for "support staff"](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSccaOu1DpvnjQjw481iNsLDLEZp0hq3tovZv0xPjYNwnAbnlA/viewform).

## Tips

- Is your project accessible and
  [Section 508](https://before-you-ship.18f.gov/laws/508/) compliant? The team
  will need to incorporate this throughout the project, but you'll also need to
  set up a review at least two weeks before launch.
- How good is your code test coverage? Before shipping, you should have codecov
  badges on your GitHub repo READMEs and coverage should be above 90 percent
  (green). (This is not a perfect measure for code quality, but a helpful
  check.) The testing working group recommends reviewing your status early and
  often. _Ask #wg-testing if you have questions._
- Are your APIs up to the [API Standards](https://github.com/18f/api-standards)?
  _Ask the {% slack_channel "api" %} if you have questions._
- Make sure you have all the social media metadata and preview images.
