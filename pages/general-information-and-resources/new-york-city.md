## How do I...

### Visit as a guest?

See the
[TTS at WTC](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bqTlkaxRfbPdf0HlYI3TZkwIT9vd2HcN-nh6rTrkJzE/edit#heading=h.gno5incmiuxa)
guide.

### Get building access?

See the
[TTS at WTC](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bqTlkaxRfbPdf0HlYI3TZkwIT9vd2HcN-nh6rTrkJzE/edit)
guide.

### Get my fingerprints and badge?

[Set up an appointment](https://app3.timetrade.com/tc/login.do?url=usaccess) to
visit room 200 of [26 Federal Plaza](https://goo.gl/maps/PX99MsBHdnD2).

### Access the building after hours?

Building hours are 6am - 7pm. While you can stay in the space later, you won't
be able to get back in if you go to the bathroom or something.

### Book rooms for meetings?

Use [BookIT](https://bookit.gsa.gov/).

### Use the monitors/docks?

[The DisplayLink docks](https://www.targus.com/us/universal-usb-3-0-dv4k-docking-station-with-power-dock177usz)
can be used with Macs over USB, though will need to install the drivers.

1. Open [Self
   Service]({% page "/getting-started/classes/gsa-internal-tools/#self-service" %})
1. `Install` the `Display Link` driver

If that doesn't work, we have a couple of DVI to HDMI cords sitting by the 18F
desks that can connect to the monitors directly.

### Use the printers?

Refer to
[our printer information document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ikw7kfeY10lnImZHN7zq5wNjaTRBdTPkZj4QG7-z3d0/edit#)
for more details.

### Get on the wireless?

The wifi network for GSA staff is `gsa-wireless` - use your ENT credentials.
Guests can use `GSA-Guest` - type `guest wifi` in Slack to get the password,
which rotates regularly.

## Where are the...

### Bathrooms

In the center "core" of each floor. You will need your badge to get back.

### Mother’s rooms

There's a mother's (aka lactation) room on the 54th floor on the southeast side.
It has outlets, a sink, and a fridge. Ideally you should book time in the room
with BookIt.

### Snacks and drinks

There is [a coffee shop on the 64th floor](https://forfivecoffee.com/). You need
to go back down to the 1st floor to go back up to it. There are also many
options in
[the Oculus mall](https://www.westfield.com/westfieldworldtradecenter/entertainment/dining),
or across the street at [Brookfield Place](https://bfplny.com/food).

### Spare keyboards and mice

There are supply rooms with pens, sticky notes, etc. If you need something
ordered, see the [purchase
requests]({% page "/general-information-and-resources/purchase-requests/#office-supplies" %})
page.

## Transit subsidy

See the [Transit Benefit]({% page "/transit-benefit" %}) page for information on
enrollment and deactivation. This
[page on InSite](https://insite.gsa.gov/portal/content/500219) has additional
information.

### Use your card

Although it is technically a debit card, when you put the card in an MTA
machine, select `Credit Card` as your payment method, and use the same office
ZIP code. The balance resets on the 10th of every month. The new balance is
intended to cover the following month's transit, but you can use it at any time.

## NYC events

We have a team breakfast every Thursday morning (BYOB - bring your own
breakfast) and a happy hour outing the first Thursday of every month. Both are
optional, but lots of fun. Ask to be added to the invite in #nyc.

There is also a shared calendar. If it doesn't show up in Google Calendar
already, try adding
`gsa.gov_envrspjqmjn4id95uc2fq3l45s@group.calendar.google.com` under "Other
calendars".

## Who works here?

You can find everyone who works in the {% slack_channel "nyc" %} channel in
Slack.

## How do people dress?

TTS folx in the office usually range from casual t-shirts to business casual
(jeans and a collared shirts, or blouse). Suits would not be out of place, but
are not universal (and pretty rare for TTS folks when we come into the office).
The office can be a little cold so cardigans, blazers, or sportcoats (sweaters
and hoodies are pretty common, too). On your first day, folks from other parts
of GSA will mostly be dressed business casual. Your first step onboarding
includes being sworn in as a civil servant, which in the New York office likely
takes place while looking over New York Harbor with a view of the Statue of
Liberty. Some felt it was hokey, others were moved, many felt both. Several were
glad they dressed for the occasion. We care more that you are comfortable and
confident as yourself rather than following someone’s particular rules of
formality. And yes, you should totally feel free to dye your hair in rainbow
colors and rock that undercut. You be you.

## Onboarding

- Join the {% slack_channel "nyc" %} channel in Slack.
- Ask to be added to the
  [TTS NYC Google Group](https://groups.google.com/a/gsa.gov/g/TTS-nyc).
- If you are an NYC resident, confirm that
  [local tax](https://www.tax.ny.gov/pit/file/tax_tables.htm) is being withheld
  from [your
  paycheck]({% page "/getting-started/classes/gsa-internal-tools/#employee-express" %}).
  - If not, contact kc-payroll.finance@gsa.gov
