### Business cards

To make best use of our resources, we use business cards sparingly. However, if
you expect to use them for outreach or a specific meeting with partners, you can
request standard GSA business cards, which don't reflect TTS or 18F branding.

To initiate your request,

1. Head to <https://envisionprintservices.com>.
   Verify your email, then create an account for yourself. Use a password that
   you are comfortable sharing with a member of the TTS Ops team, as they will
   need to later log in as you and make the purchase.
2. After your account is set up, fill in the required information, finalize the
   design of your cards, and review your proof. Continue to checkout, choosing
   the quantity you’d like and adding the address that you’d like your business
   cards mailed to.
3. Once you are on the final step of the order and credit card information is
   requested, it’s time to request approval through the
   [micropurchase request form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd-GoOE9xWWfJvdZNRP3SE7mj5ysI_RfM8brxdG8YpyJV9yKA/viewform).
   Your order will be reviewed by the TTS Ops team, and once approved, a member
   of the TTS Ops team will log into your Envision account and make the payment.
   Your business cards will arrive 7-10 business days after that.

If you want TTS/18F branding, you must purchase your own business cards.
However, please get a final approval from the TTS Outreach team before placing
the order.

### Certificates

[General information](https://before-you-ship.18f.gov/infrastructure/certs/)

Purchasing SSL/TLS/ECA certificates fall somewhere between a software request
and a domain renewal request. There is no ATO required for SSL Certificates,
however, FITARA approval is still required. To obtain SSL/ECA Certificates, you
will need to submit the micropurchase request form and follow the instructions.
You will need to make a copy of this
[Section 889 Open Market Justification](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jRMwRi94_O_YJ_0JkvKtRhniitjU2ZMFggXRirL6eOE/edit#heading=h.mw15bdywiu3d),
fill it out, and attach the link to the
[micropurchase request form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd-GoOE9xWWfJvdZNRP3SE7mj5ysI_RfM8brxdG8YpyJV9yKA/viewform).
Then, the TTS Tech Portfolio will review the documentation and work with the
OCIO to get FITARA approval. Once FITARA approval is obtained, the TTS Tech
Portfolio will send the micropurchase request through the approval process. Once
the purchase is approved, the purchase card holder will reach out to you to make
the purchase.

### Domain renewals

When a dotgov domain is up for renewal, submit a
[micropurchase request form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd-GoOE9xWWfJvdZNRP3SE7mj5ysI_RfM8brxdG8YpyJV9yKA/viewform).
After you submit the form, follow the instructions for next steps. If the
portfolio does not want the domain to be renewed, please reach out to the
purchase card holder so they can cancel the domain.

### Office supplies

If you have access to a GSA office, check the supply rooms for what you need. If
not available, fill out the
[micropurchase request form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd-GoOE9xWWfJvdZNRP3SE7mj5ysI_RfM8brxdG8YpyJV9yKA/viewform).
The designated TTS Ops team member will determine whether or not to recommend
your request for approval by the TTS Director of Operations. Please note that
most office supplies are not able to be sent to teleworkers.

### Services

Examples of services TTS has procured:

- Engineering support
- Design services
- 3PAO service

Please follow the recommended steps below when ordering services under $10,000:

1. For all requests, submit the
   [micropurchase request form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd-GoOE9xWWfJvdZNRP3SE7mj5ysI_RfM8brxdG8YpyJV9yKA/viewform)
   to initiate the request process. It will instruct you on next steps.
2. If your services are IT related, you will need to make a copy of this
   [Section 889 Open Market Justification](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jRMwRi94_O_YJ_0JkvKtRhniitjU2ZMFggXRirL6eOE/edit#heading=h.mw15bdywiu3d),
   fill it out, and attach the link to the micropurchase request form. You will
   also need to have a vendor quote for the services you are requesting.
3. After you submit the form, the Office of Acquisition will review your
   request. Please be ready to address any questions, comments, or feedback at
   your earliest convenience.
4. Once OA has reviewed your request, they will send it through the approval
   process in the micropurchase request sheet. Your supervisor will approve via
   a link in their email.
5. Once the purchase is approved, the purchase card holder will reach out to you
   to complete the purchase.
