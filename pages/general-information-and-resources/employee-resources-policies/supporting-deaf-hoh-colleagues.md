Tips for working effectively & inclusively with your Deaf and Hard of Hearing colleagues at TTS:

* Recognize that it may be difficult or impossible for a Deaf colleague to multi-task during a meeting. Asking them to look at a document is asking them to shift attention away from interpreter or captions and reduces their ability to participate in the conversation.
* Chatter on calls is hard to participate in and hard for interpreters to parse — make room for pauses.
* On video calls, use the hand raise feature to minimize people speaking over each other, which is difficult for interpreters to relay.
* Ask the Deaf person you’re working with what is most helpful to them in terms of communication approaches.
* Practice ASL. Signing and/or spelling shows you are making an effort.
* Share agendas and meeting materials ahead of time whenever possible.
* Facial expressions, body language, and the chat are all non-verbal ways to add context and color to the meeting conversation — use them!
* When working with Deaf and/or Hard of Hearing colleagues, don’t focus on *what* we are (Deaf), focus on *who* we are.
