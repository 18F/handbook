Tips for working effectively & inclusively with your Deaf and Hard of Hearing colleagues at TTS:

* Ask the Deaf person you’re working with what is most helpful to them in terms of communication approaches.
* Share agendas and meeting materials ahead of time whenever possible.
* Recognize that it may be difficult or impossible for a Deaf colleague to multi-task during a meeting. Asking them to look at a document is asking them to shift attention away from interpreter or captions and reduces their ability to participate in the conversation.
* Chatter on calls is hard to participate in and hard for interpreters to parse — make room for pauses.
* On video calls, use the hand raise feature to minimize people speaking over each other, which is difficult for interpreters to relay.
* Practice ASL. Signing and/or spelling shows you are making an effort.
* Facial expressions, body language, and the chat are all non-verbal ways to add context and color to the meeting conversation — use them!
* When working with Deaf and/or Hard of Hearing colleagues, don’t focus on *what* they are (Deaf), focus on *who* they are.

## Hosting accessible meetings

When we host a large meeting, we'll often record it so that people can watch after-the-fact.

We need both the meeting itself and the recording to be fully accessible. 

That means making sure that ASL interpreters are highlighted in the recording, so that a Deaf or Hard of Hearing person can watch the ASL interpretation along with the recorded meeting.

Here's a short guide to faciliating an accessible meeting -- 

### Before the meeting 
+ Request ASL interpreters and CART transcription.
  + Send the interpreters and transcriber the agenda plus any presentation materials ahead of time. 
+ Consider using [Zoom]({% page "tools/zoom" %})  to host the meeting, since Zoom's [Spotlight feature](https://support.zoom.com/hc/en/article?id=zm_kb&sysparm_article=KB0066300) allows the facilitator to spotlight ASL interpreters.

### The day of the meeting
+ Join the Zoom room 10 to 15 minutes early. Chat with the interpreters, captioners, and speakers/preserter to make sure all have what they need.
+ Make interpreters co-hosts of the meeting.
  + This allows the interpreters to pin Deaf participants during the meeting. It also allows them to Spotlight themselves.

### During the meeting
+ During the meeting, the facilitator needs to Spotlight each speaker when they begin presenting, and un-Spotlight each speaker after they are done.
+ During the meeting, the facilitator needs to keep their Zoom set to Speaker view.
  + Switching to Gallery view will affect the recording and ASL interpreters will show up as tiny thumbnails, instead of Spotlighted.
