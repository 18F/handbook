Tools, services, points of contact, and tips for navigating the resources
available to individuals and teams.

Once GSA has established that a person is Deaf and/or is Hard of Hearing (HoH),
they should not have to provide additional medical documentation for assistive
technologies or services related to that disability—only any other reasonable
accommodations that they might need. If you receive a request for medical
documentation, consult GSA’s
[Office of Civil Rights](https://www.gsa.gov/reference/civil-rights-programs)
to determine whether that request is appropriate.

## Services for remote meetings

### CART (Captioning)

In order to provide accessible telecommunications services for Deaf/HoH and
speech-disabled employees, GSA has a contract with CART (Communication Access
Real-time Translation) provider for these shared services. These services are
not free, they are billed to a task order (a request for services from within an
established contract) that GSA pays for and should only be used when needed to
accommodate the individual. There is no cost to program offices (like 18F, OPP,
PIF, etc.) for using these services, and CART services do not require medical
documentation.

The general public who are Deaf/HoH or those having speech disabilities can also
use this service to conduct business with federal agencies.

To access captioning services:

- Send an email at least 12 hours prior to the meeting (2-3 days is preferred)
  to [BISCOORD@BISWORLD.COM](mailto:BISCOORD@BISWORLD.COM) with the following
  information:
  - **Requestors Name:**
  - **Event Title:**
  - **Event Point of contact:**
  - **Phone number and pin for conference line:**
  - **Event date:**
  - **Start and End time (include timezone):**
  - **Names of the speakers / panelist / participants** that are going to
    present on the event:
  - **Preparation materials** (acronyms, agenda, PowerPoint, documents) anything
    that will help the Writer/Captioner to prepare for the call: i.
  - _Optional information to provide:_ What platform the event will be on and
    URL of the event.
- Confirmation information will be emailed to the Requestor’s Name with the
  captioning URL.

Visit the
[Live Captioning InSite page](https://insite.gsa.gov/employee-resources/information-technology/do-it-yourself-self-help/virtual-and-online-meetings/closed-captioning)
for further details.

#### Integrating with Zoom for Government

To integrate captions from the provided captioner with Zoom:

- You must be signed in and the meeting host or co-host and in the meeting.
- Select the three dots button on the captioner’s square and click **Assign a
  participant to type**.
- If this is not visible, head to the bottom toolbar and select **Live
  Transcript** (it may be under **More…** on smaller screens) and then **Set up
  manual captioner** and then **Assign a participant to type**.

Visit the
[Zoom documentation page on manual captioning](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/207279736-Managing-manual-captioning#h_d6539cb1-0205-43ec-8cca-4ea1b3a4799f)
for further details.

##### Attaching captions to Zoom meeting recordings

When recording a meeting, Zoom will record captions in a `.vtt` file
automatically, which captures both the caption text and when to show them on the
video.

The caption file can be attached to the video after it is uploaded to sites like
Google Drive (commonly used at TTS). See how to
[add caption tracks to your videos in Google Drive](https://support.google.com/drive/answer/1372218).

### ASL interpreters

An American Sign Language interpreter can be provided when two parties in a
virtual meeting experience a communication barrier (e.g. Google Meet or Zoom).

These services are not free, they are billed to a task order (a request for
services from within an established contract) that GSA pays for and should only
be used when needed to accommodate the individual. There is no cost to program
offices (like 18F, OPP, PIF, etc.) for using these services unless an event is
cancelled. GSA will be billed for events that are not cancelled within 48 hours
of event and reimbursement may be requested by the employee's office.

To request ASL interpreters:

- Fill out the
  [ASL Service Intake Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc0i5qH-JeF22VmfQ8v2v4t6cP0S4Rb1o1QnU42Iyvyb1Y74A/viewform)
  at least 72 hours before the event is scheduled.
- You will be asked to provide information about the reasonable accommodation on
  file that supports this request.
- A coordinator will be in touch via email to confirm the details.

#### Integrating with Zoom for Government

Sign language interpreters are shown in dedicated video channels that are pinned
and spotlighted, identifying the specific type of sign language they are
interpreting. Participants can then select which sign language video channel
they’d like to view, and resize or relocate the video window as needed.

- You must be signed in and the meeting host or co-host.
- Before the meeting:
  - **Sign language interpretation view** must be enabled in the host’s user
    settings in the Zoom web portal. Click on **Settings**, the **Meeting** tab,
    and look for the **In Meeting (Advanced)** section.
  - If Zoom for Desktop is running, restart it.
  - Select your scheduled meeting in Zoom for Desktop and click **Edit**, then
    **Select sign language interpretation (video channels) below**.
- During the meeting:
  - In the bottom toolbar, select **Interpretation** and select the interpreter.
  - Select the three dots button on the interpreter’s square and click **Allow
    to talk**. Alternatively, you can find the interpreter in the
    **Participants** panel and click **Allow to talk** there as well.

Visit the
[Zoom documentation page on enabling sign language interpretation view](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/9513103461005-Enabling-Sign-Language-interpretation-view#h_01GFC7KAKXZZWWW1YRWWSZJ5GB:~:text=confirm%20the%20setting.-,User,-To%20enable%20or)
for further information.

### Video relay services (VRS)

In order to use video relay services in combination with video meeting tools
like Google Meet, the Deaf/HoH individual will need to install GSA-approved
software called Z5 app that connects them by video to a sign language
interpreter. To get this software:

1.  The individual’s Supervisor should
    [submit a software request](https://gsa.servicenowservices.com/sp/?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=1bfdfdca78d3a400ce3ddff91a64940b)
    on behalf of the individual. Individuals can also submit their own request,
    but it will then immediately get routed to their supervisor for approval.
    1. Pending the individual’s specific communication needs, in the software
       request Comments field, note that GSA IT should contact the individual
       for setup instructions by email, and not by phone.
2.  Install the VRS software app. GSA IT will contact the individual for setup
    and installation.
    1. Download Z5 app for mobile and/or desktop, which is GSA-approved. If Z5
       cannot be downloaded or installed, [contact GSA
       IT]({% page "/getting-started/classes/gsa-internal-tools/#it-service-desk" %})
       to make it available in [Self
       Service]({% page "/getting-started/classes/gsa-internal-tools/#self-service" %}).
    2. Create an account at Z5’s
       [Registration page](https://www.zvrs.com/registration/) and follow their
       instructions.
    3. After creating an account, you may need to wait for few days for the
       account to be activated. Also, a Z5 enterprise account manager may reach
       out to you to provide support, answer questions and verify contact info.

#### Connect to a meeting with video relay

##### For a Google Hangouts/Meet meeting:

1.  Dial (877) 709-5797 from your videophone (the Z5 app). Press option 1 for
    English or option 2 for Spanish
2.  Connect to a video interpreter and provide the name of your Federal agency
    (In this case, "GSA") or Agency Bureau (AB) code (GSA’s AB code is 4700)
3.  Provide the phone number you want to call to the interpreter and the PIN,
    which both are listed under "Join by phone" on your Google Calendar invite
4.  Begin your conversation

##### For a Zoom meeting:

1.  Dial (877) 709-5797 from your videophone (the Z5 app). Press option 1 for
    English or option 2 for Spanish
2.  Connect to a video interpreter and provide the name of your Federal agency
    (in this case, "GSA") or Agency Bureau code (in this case, "4700")
3.  Provide the phone number you want to call to the interpreter, which is
    listed under "Dial [by your location]" on your Google Calendar invite. Make
    sure that every Calendar invite also includes the dial-in number — a Zoom
    URL itself will not allow an interpreter to join in the meeting
4.  Begin your conversation

#### Video relay tips

- Add (877) 709-5797 to your Z5 contact list for a quick dial
- Interpreters can facilitate information in both directions. Deaf/HoH
  individuals using their own voice in conversation (instead of the interpreter
  voicing for them) should inform the interpreter at the beginning that they’ll
  be using Voice Carry Over (VCO). Alternatively, they should ask the
  interpreter to convert the individual’s conversation from sign language to
  voice.
- If you are using Voice Carry Over (VCO) and the interpreter is not expected to
  use their voice, mute the interpreter’s phone line from the Google Meet or
  Zoom meeting to reduce background noises and microphone echos.
- Inform an interpreter of how long the meeting will be (e.g. 30 minutes, 1
  hour, etc.) before it begins. This helps them determine whether or not to have
  a partner to switch over during the meeting, preventing cognitive fatigue for
  an interpreter in a long meeting
- Inform the meeting host ahead of time that they may see an unrecognizable
  number dialed in—this is FedRelay.

### Other software

If an individual has used other software that isn’t included, follow the
instructions on the [Software]({% page "/software/" %}) page to check whether it
is already approved by GSA, and how to request it.

## Accessing in-person services

There are times when a Deaf/HoH individual may desire or find it more convenient
to have a live interpreter, such as in-person events like workshops or group
meetings.

Choose a service provider that the individual has previously had a good
experience with if you can. Find organizations or interpreters the individual
has worked with before that have knowledge of their specialized technical
vocabulary.

Each program office is responsible for the cost of these services.

### Planning for on-site interpreting services

#### Booking and purchasing:

1.  Identify the service provider and their rates
2.  The individual or their supervisor should email their Director for approval
    of the expense. For 18F, this is likely your Chapter Director. For OPP, this
    is likely your Portfolio Lead. Include:
    1. the date of services
    2. an estimated ceiling for number of hours needed
    3. an estimated ceiling for the cost of services
3.  Export the approved email as a PDF
4.  [Submit a micropurchase request]({% page "/purchase-requests/" %})

#### Best practices for working with an on-site interpreter(s):

- It is standard practice to have two interpreters available to prevent them
  from having cognitive fatigue that would result in poor performance. At best,
  they would switch every 20-30 minutes and assist each other if they miss
  something.
- Share slides, agendas, [glossaries]({% page "/glossary/" %}), or other
  materials with interpreters ahead of time.
- Schedule interpreters to arrive at least 15 minutes prior to the event to
  allow the individuals and interpreters to meet beforehand, review any
  specialized vocabulary, and share individual preferences for communication and
  signing styles.
- If possible, work with a consistent pool of interpreters so they can be
  familiar with TTS/GSA work culture and technical signs. This will help avoid
  emotional labor of having to constantly educate new, different interpreters
  each time.
- Keep points of contact for scheduling, coordinating, and payment to a minimum
  to avoid creating emotional labor for the interpreters.
- People often use "interpreter" and "translator" interchangeably, and while
  they're similar, they differ. In general, an interpreter interprets spoken
  information in real-time, while a translator converts information from
  written/recorded materials. So when inquiring for an interpreter, don't make
  the mistake of calling them a translator.
- Remember that interpreting goes both directions. Interpreters can convert
  spoken language into sign language and sign language into spoken language
  based on the group’s needs.

### Planning for accessible events

Section508.gov maintains a useful guide to [hosting accessible meetings](https://www.section508.gov/create/accessible-meetings/).
It includes actions to take before, during, and after your meeting.

## Who to contact

### GSA Human Resources (HR)

GSA HR is helpful from an overall GSA policy standpoint, and can help point you
to specific individuals for the most up-to-date resources. Ask them for points
of contact for Reasonable Accommodation Coordinators in each region, who can
help organize on-site resources for their area.

### Office of Civil Rights

GSA prohibits discrimination in the workplace and the
[Office of Civil Rights](https://www.gsa.gov/reference/civil-rights-programs)
upholds the agency’s commitment to becoming a model Equal Employment Opportunity
(EEO) employer.

Contact the Office of Civil Rights to:

- Learn about what opportunities and resources exist outside of this list.
- Help determine whether a request for medical documentation supporting a
  temporary or permanent disability is appropriate
- Report discrimination when an individual is applying for employment at GSA or
  as a current or former GSA employee
- File an administrative complaint requesting that existing electronic and
  information technology (E&IT), such as a GSA branded website or non-accessible
  document that does not conform to the Section 508 standards, be reviewed and
  brought into compliance with the provisions of Section 508.

#### Equal Employment Opportunity Program

Work with this program within the Office of Civil Rights to get assistive
technology solutions through the
