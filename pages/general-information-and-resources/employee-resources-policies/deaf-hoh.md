Tools, services, points of contact, and tips for navigating the resources
available to individuals and teams.

## Services provided by GSA

Once GSA has established that a person is Deaf and/or is Hard of Hearing (HoH),
they should not have to provide additional medical documentation for assistive
technologies or services related to that disability—only any other reasonable
accommodations that they might need. If you receive a request for medical
documentation, consult GSA’s
[Office of Civil Rights](https://www.gsa.gov/about-us/organization/office-of-civil-rights-overview)
to determine whether that request is appropriate.

### CART

In order to provide accessible telecommunications services for Deaf/HoH and
speech-disabled employees, GSA has a contract with CART provider for these
shared services. These services are not free, they are billed to a task order (a
request for services from within an established contract) that GSA pays for and
should only be used when needed to accommodate the individual. There is no cost
to program offices (like 18F, OPP, PIF, etc.) for using these services, and CART
services do not require medical documentation. Visit
[Live Captioning InSite](https://insite.gsa.gov/employee-resources/information-technology/do-it-yourself-self-help/virtual-and-online-meetings/closed-captioning)
page for further details.

The general public who are Deaf/HoH or those having speech disabilities can also
use this service to conduct business with federal agencies.

## Accessing remote services

To access remote interpreting or captioning services:

1. Send an email 3 business days prior to the meeting to
   [BISCOORD@BISWORLD.COM](mailto:BISCOORD@BISWORLD.COM) with the following
   information: a. **Requestors Name:** b. **Event Title:** c. **Event Point of
   contact:** d. **Phone number and pin for conference line:** e. **Event
   date:** f. **Start and Endtime (include timezone):** g. **Names of the
   speakers / panelist / participants** that are going to present on the event:
   h. **Prepartion materials** (acronyms, agenda, PowerPoint, documents)
   anything that will help the Writer/Captioner to prepare for the call: i.
   _Optional information to provide:_ What platform the event will be on and URL
   of the event.
2. Confirmation information will be emailed to the Requestor’s Name with the
   captioning URL.

### Video relay services (VRS)

#### Dependencies for [video relay](https://www.federalrelay.us/vrs)

In order to use video relay services in combination with video meeting tools
like Google Meet, the Deaf/HoH individual will need to install GSA-approved
software called Z5 app that connects them by video to a sign language
interpreter. To get this software:

1.  The individual’s Supervisor should
    [submit a software request](https://gsa.servicenowservices.com/sp/?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=1bfdfdca78d3a400ce3ddff91a64940b)
    on behalf of the individual. Individuals can also submit their own request,
    but it will then immediately get routed to their supervisor for approval.
    1. Pending the individual’s specific communication needs, in the software
       request Comments field, note that GSA IT should contact the individual
       for setup instructions by email, and not by phone.
2.  Install the VRS software app. GSA IT will contact the individual for setup
    and installation.
    1. Download Z5 app for mobile and/or desktop, which is GSA-approved. If Z5
       cannot be downloaded or installed, [contact GSA
       IT]({% page "/getting-started/classes/gsa-internal-tools/#it-service-desk" %})
       to make it available in [Self
       Service]({% page "/getting-started/classes/gsa-internal-tools/#self-service" %}).
    2. Create an account at Z5’s
       [Registration page](https://www.zvrs.com/registration/) and follow their
       instructions.
    3. After creating an account, you may need to wait for few days for the
       account to be activated. Also, a Z5 enterprise account manager may reach
       out to you to provide support, answer questions and verify contact info.

#### Connect to a meeting with video relay

##### For a Google Hangouts/Meet meeting:

1.  Dial (877) 709-5797 from your videophone (the Z5 app). Press option 1 for
    English or option 2 for Spanish
2.  Connect to a video interpreter and provide the name of your Federal agency
    (In this case, "GSA") or Agency Bureau (AB) code (GSA’s AB code is 4700)
3.  Provide the phone number you want to call to the interpreter and the PIN,
    which both are listed under "Join by phone" on your Google Calendar invite
4.  Begin your conversation

##### For a Zoom meeting:

1.  Dial (877) 709-5797 from your videophone (the Z5 app). Press option 1 for
    English or option 2 for Spanish
2.  Connect to a video interpreter and provide the name of your Federal agency
    (in this case, "GSA") or Agency Bureau code (in this case, "4700")
3.  Provide the phone number you want to call to the interpreter, which is
    listed under "Dial [by your location]" on your Google Calendar invite. Make
    sure that every Calendar invite also includes the dial-in number — a Zoom
    URL itself will not allow an interpreter to join in the meeting
4.  Begin your conversation

#### Video relay tips

- Add (877) 709-5797 to your Z5 contact list for a quick dial
- Interpreters can facilitate information in both directions. Deaf/HoH
  individuals using their own voice in conversation (instead of the interpreter
  voicing for them) should inform the interpreter at the beginning that they’ll
  be using Voice Carry Over (VCO). Alternatively, they should ask the
  interpreter to convert the individual’s conversation from sign language to
  voice.
- If you are using Voice Carry Over (VCO) and the interpreter is not expected to
  use their voice, mute the interpreter’s phone line from the Google Meet or
  Zoom meeting to reduce background noises and microphone echos.
- Inform an interpreter of how long the meeting will be (e.g. 30 minutes, 1
  hour, etc.) before it begins. This helps them determine whether or not to have
  a partner to switch over during the meeting, preventing cognitive fatigue for
  an interpreter in a long meeting
- Inform the meeting host ahead of time that they may see an unrecognizable
  number dialed in—this is FedRelay.

### Relay conference captioning (RCC)

[Relay conference captioning](https://www.federalrelay.us/rcc) is real-time
captioning for meetings over the phone or internet, including web conferencing,
by creating text in a computer window. **This is the only service that needs to
be scheduled in advance:** please book at least 12 hours ahead for English, and
48 hours ahead for Spanish.

#### Schedule a meeting with Relay Conference Captioning

- Follow the instructions on the
  [FedRelay RCC page](https://www.federalrelay.us/rcc)
- When the booking is confirmed, you will receive a link for accessing the
  transcript at the time of the event
- Add the link for accessing the live transcript to the meeting invitation, so
  that individuals using it can find it easily when they join the meeting

#### Relay Conference captioning tips

- For the Federal Agency Name field, GSA is **4700**
- Join the meeting early if you can so that you can make sure the captioner is
  set up properly.
- Include a good description of the event so they know what words or acryonms to
  expect. For example, if you're giving a technical talk the captioner might not
  be familiar with some of the words you expect to use, so including them will
  help the captions be more accurate.
- Consider also including the phonetic pronunciation for words or you expect to
  use a lot. (Use your judgement, you don't want to overwhelm them either!)
- You are also able to chat through the captioning interface. You can use this
  to correct or supplement captions if necessary.

### Other software

If an individual has used other software that isn’t included in the FedRelay
package, follow the instructions on the [Software]({% page "/software/" %}) page
to check whether it is already approved by GSA, and how to request it.

## Accessing in-person services

There are times when a Deaf/HoH individual may desire or find it more convenient
to have a live interpreter than to manipulate the FedRelay tools, such as
in-person events like workshops or group meetings.

Choose a service provider that the individual has previously had a good
experience with if you can. GSA has not allocated centralized funds to support
costs associated with accommodating employees outside of FedRelay, which leaves
some flexibility and choice up to the individual. Find organizations or
interpreters the individual has worked with before that have knowledge of their
specialized technical vocabulary.

Each program office is responsible for the cost of these services.

### Planning for on-site interpreting services

#### Booking and purchasing:

1.  Identify the service provider and their rates
2.  The individual or their supervisor should email their Director for approval
    of the expense. For 18F, this is likely your Chapter Director. For OPP, this
    is likely your Portfolio Lead. Include:
    1. the date of services
    2. an estimated ceiling for number of hours needed
    3. an estimated ceiling for the cost of services
3.  Export the approved email as a PDF
4.  [Submit a micropurchase request]({% page "/purchase-requests/" %})

#### Best practices for working with an on-site interpreter(s):

- It is standard practice to have two interpreters available to prevent them
  from having cognitive fatigue that would result in poor performance. At best,
  they would switch every 20-30 minutes and assist each other if they miss
  something.
- Share slides, agendas, [glossaries]({% page "/glossary/" %}), or other
  materials with interpreters ahead of time.
- Schedule interpreters to arrive at least 15 minutes prior to the event to
  allow the individuals and interpreters to meet beforehand, review any
  specialized vocabulary, and share individual preferences for communication and
  signing styles.
- If possible, work with a consistent pool of interpreters so they can be
  familiar with TTS/GSA work culture and technical signs. This will help avoid
  emotional labor of having to constantly educate new, different interpreters
  each time.
- Keep points of contact for scheduling, coordinating, and payment to a minimum
  to avoid creating emotional labor for the interpreters.
- People often use "interpreter" and "translator" interchangeably, and while
  they're similar, they differ. In general, an interpreter interprets spoken
  information in real-time, while a translator converts information from
  written/recorded materials. So when inquiring for an interpreter, don't make
  the mistake of calling them a translator.
- Remember that interpreting goes both directions. Interpreters can convert
  spoken language into sign language and sign language into spoken language
  based on the group’s needs.

### Planning for accessible events

GSA maintains a very useful InSite page on
[hosting accessible meetings](https://insite.gsa.gov/employee-resources/information-technology/508-accessibility/hosting-accessible-meetings).
It’s worth VPNing in for and includes actions to take before, during, and after
your meeting.

## Who to contact

### GSA Human Resources (HR)

GSA HR is helpful from an overall GSA policy standpoint, and can help point you
to specific individuals for the most up-to-date resources. Ask them for points
of contact for Reasonable Accommodation Coordinators in each region, who can
help organize on-site resources for their area.

### Office of Civil Rights

GSA prohibits discrimination in the workplace and the
[Office of Civil Rights](https://www.gsa.gov/about-us/organization/office-of-civil-rights-overview)
upholds the agency’s commitment to becoming a model Equal Employment Opportunity
(EEO) employer.

Contact the Office of Civil Rights to:

- Learn about what opportunities and resources exist outside of this list.
- Help determine whether a request for medical documentation supporting a
  temporary or permanent disability is appropriate
- Report discrimination when an individual is applying for employment at GSA or
  as a current or former GSA employee
- File an administrative complaint requesting that existing electronic and
  information technology (E&IT), such as a GSA branded website or non-accessible
  document that does not conform to the Section 508 standards, be reviewed and
  brought into compliance with the provisions of Section 508.

#### Equal Employment Opportunity Program

Work with this program within the Office of Civil Rights to get assistive
technology solutions through the
[Department of Defense's Computer Accommodation Program](https://www.cap.mil/)
