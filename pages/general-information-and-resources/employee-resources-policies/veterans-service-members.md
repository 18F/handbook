Welcome veterans & service members!
We are glad you decided to continue your service with TTS. 

There are numerous resources across several agencies for veterans, service members, and their families. This page helps you locate key benefits and resources.

# Veteran and servicemember federal communities
- TTS has a Veteran [Affinity Group]({% page "/about-us/deia/#affinity-groups" %}) that gathers in the {% slack_channel "vets" "Vets" %} Slack channel.
- GSA has a [Veterans Employee Resources Association](https://insite.gsa.gov/about-us/agency-initiatives/veterans-employee-resources-association) (VERA).
- The [Federal Military Family Workforce Network](https://openopps.usajobs.gov/communities/14) connects military and veteran spouses, caregivers, and survivors with resources for sustainable federal careers. It was created by and for federally employed military family members, and is hosted on OPM’s Open Opportunities platform.

# Leave
There are four [types of leave](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/1-dm0tptMsZ2FKhuta52RFEiN4Sfkd9coYN0_tjQCe9Y/edit) that are offered specifically to veterans and/or service members:
- [Military leave]({% page "/travel-and-leave/leave/#military-leave" %}) for active duty, active duty training, and inactive duty training in the National Guard or as a Reservist.
- [Military spouse relocation leave]({% page "/travel-and-leave/leave/#military-spouse-relocation" %})
- [Disabled Veteran Leave]({% page "/travel-and-leave/leave/#disabled-veteran-leave-dvl" %}) for employees with a service-connected disability rating of 30 percent or more, to use during their first year of federal employment
- [Funeral leave]({% page "/travel-and-leave/leave/#military" %}) for veterans to participate in a funeral ceremony for a member of the Armed Forces. Funeral leave is also available for anyone who needs to plan or attend services of an immediate relative who has suffered a combat-related death.

# Entering Active Duty status
If you are called to active duty, no matter the length of time, contact the [FAS Benefits Specialist](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15glvq9UakKUN8XTRTa6gRkhBHm2whhQyAGmf8ibTtBs/edit) who corresponds to your last name. They can help with GSA’s [Checklist for Civilian Employees Entering Extended Active Duty](https://www.gsa.gov/reference/forms/civilian-employees-entering-extended-active-duty-checklist).

# Military Service Deposits (“Buying back”)
Veterans can receive retirement credit for their military service. This is often called “buying back”. You’ll work with OHRM to complete paperwork and make a financial deposit covering your military service.
- InSite has information on [Military Service Deposits](https://insite.gsa.gov/topics/hr-pay-and-leave/benefits/military-service-deposits). 
- DFAS offers a [Military Service Earnings/Buy Back Estimator](https://www.dfas.mil/civilianemployees/militaryservice/militaryservicedeposits/estimator/).
- Your [FAS Benefits Specialist](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15glvq9UakKUN8XTRTa6gRkhBHm2whhQyAGmf8ibTtBs/edit) is your point of contact for questions and assistance.

# Domestic employees teleworking overseas (DETO) 
Domestic employees teleworking overseas (DETO) arrangements are a workplace flexibility that GSA considers on a case-by-case basis. A sponsored DETO is an employee who has a spouse overseas on military, foreign service, or civilian orders. 

DETO information and criteria are available in GSA’s [Telework and Remote Work Policy](https://www.gsa.gov/directives-library/gsa-telework-and-remote-work-policy). The DETO process requires GSA and Department of State approvals which may take 6 months to a year. Employees seeking DETO approval should consult with their supervisor immediately after receiving notice of an upcoming overseas tour.
