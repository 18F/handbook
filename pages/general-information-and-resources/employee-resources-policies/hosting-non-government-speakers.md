TTS teams, [Guilds]({% page "/working-groups-and-guilds-101/" %}), and [Working
Groups]({% page "/working-groups-and-guilds-101/" %}) have the opportunity to
invite individuals outside of the government to speak to our teams. Guest
speakers provide a unique opportunity for federal employees to learn from
industry professionals on modern practices. Hearing new perspectives provide
employees not only with different points-of-view, but also with knowledge they
can apply in their careers at TTS.

_Unfortunately, we can not compensate guests for their time and are currently
working on ways to allocate an honorarium._

## Steps for virtual meetings

If you’d like to host a non-government speaker at a guild meeting, training,
workshop, or other TTS gathering, you must follow the steps and guidelines
below.

1. Make a local copy of the
   [Outside Speaker Checklist](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F2IEMaPgfWZY2_RvSkILNnjulY8d3XDeJagAqSkFNvo/edit?usp=sharing).
   - It will help you spot any issues and the Office of General Counsel will use
     this document to review your event.
   - You will not need to turn this form in.
1. Have each outside speaker sign a
   [Gratuitous Services Agreement](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11xLRGV2mka51PnuaCLMm75lVEq1uV7N0Fn19Lyw832o/edit?usp=sharing)
   in advance of the event.
   - This is necessary because the Antideficiency Act does not permit federal
     agencies to accept voluntary services unless someone offering such services
     executes an advance written agreement that (1) states that the services are
     offered without expectation of payment, and (2) expressly waives any future
     pay claims against the government.
   - You can also ask
     [Slackbot](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/202026038-Slackbot-your-assistant-notepad-programmable-bot)
     for a link to the Gratuitous Services Agreement
1. _Optional:_ If you plan to record or take photographs of the speaker, have
   them fill out the
   [GSA Model Release Form](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_f7JsBYIVKV5aSrv96sW_SWJroECpvjiz6JmkJVbrFE/edit).
1. Put the signed Gratuitous Services Agreement and GSA Model Release Form (if
   applicable) in
   [the Gratuitous Services Agreement folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UOKVVZGdI7IlAxrqcq48-HQQr8f5U6N7).
1. Invite your speaker and let the team know on different Slack channels such as
   {% slack_channel "upcoming-in-guilds" %}

## In-person meeting

If the event takes place in a physical location, follow steps 1-4 and check out
[the Office of Administrative Services Event and Travel Approval Matrix](https://insite.gsa.gov/topics/travel-and-events/reservations-and-travel-information/event-management-conference-attendance-information?term=OAS%20Event%20and%20Travel%20Approval%20Matrix)
to make sure you get the proper approvals for the event.

If it’s going to take place after hours, you will also have to coordinate with
the Office of Mission Assurance and building management for any special after
hours security issues.

## To keep events ethical and compliant

In addition to those steps, there are a couple important things to keep in mind
when hosting speakers from outside government.

- We have to make sure the outside speaker is not here for a sales pitch, a
  discussion on what their company can do for federal agencies, or to gain
  access to information that could help them in a future procurement.
  - For example, someone from GitHub can come talk about how their internal
    teams manage open source software, but they can’t talk about how GitHub is a
    good tool for federal agencies.
- TTS must be willing to provide the same access to similarly situated
  companies.
- TTS cannot endorse or promote the entity that is speaking at GSA.

## Accessibility

Be sure to check out the resources on the [Deaf-HOH]({% page "/deaf-hoh/" %})
page to provide the most accessible telecommunications services for Deaf/HoH and
speech-disabled employees.
