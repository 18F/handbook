## The building

[50 UN Plaza](https://www.gsa.gov/portal/category/107031) is on historic Market
Street between 6th and 7th streets, in the Civic Center neighborhood. The Bay
Area Rapid Transit authority (BART) and MUNI both have underground stops at this
location, and the historic F Market streetcar line has two local stops at 6th
and 7th Streets.

TTS SF office is in room #5685 on the fifth floor. When you get off the
elevator, go to the left.

There is a lively farmers market literally out our door every Wednesday. There
are many historic buildings within walking distance---San Francisco City Hall
and the Asian Art Museum are but two of them!

## Getting here

### From San Francisco International Airport (SFO)

Public transit from SFO to the TTS San Francisco office is cheap, fairly quick,
and convenient. Take the AirTrain from your terminal of arrival to the SFO BART
station. Trains run from the airport to downtown between 15 minutes and 20
minutes with the actual travel time around 35 minutes. The office sits right
above the Civic Center stop for BART.

### From Oakland International Airport (OAK)

The smaller of the two San Francisco area airports, OAK is just across the bay
from downtown. You can hop on the automated monorail from the airport, then
change to the BART system train at OAK/Coliseum station. It's a 25 minute ride
to Civic Center BART station.

BART Service is M–F, 4 a.m. to midnight; the last train is generally 10 to 15
minutes after the hour. Saturday service is 6 a.m. to midnight. Sunday service
is 8 a.m. to midnight.

### Walking

San Francisco is a very walkable city; there are plenty of hotels, coffee shops,
restaurants, and bars within walking distance of the office. Via the F Market
streetcar, you can get to the Castro in one direction, or hop on the other
direction to the Ferry Building and the piers overlooking the Bay.

### Biking

There is a developing [bikeshare program](https://www.bayareabikeshare.com) in
the city of San Francisco.

Bike parking is next to the loading dock, entered from the far corner at
McAllister and Leavenworth. Before you can park your bike, though, you need to
print and fill out
[this form](https://drive.google.com/a/gsa.gov/file/d/0BxUQGw0LW4R9RTl5ZWl3YzF1RzQ/view),
and then activate your credential. This means you need to return to the
credentialing location where you first initiated the process for your card.
(This is probably the federal building at 450 Golden Gate). There are drop-in
hours all day on Monday from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. You can also make an appointment.
The card also requires you to come up with a six-digit PIN, so have that ready
to go.

If you have any questions about this, contact the
{% slack_channel "SF Slack Channel" %}.

### Public transit

San Francisco is very accessible by its public transportation system,
[SFMTA](https://www.sfmta.com/). The larger Bay Area is also accessible via
[BART](https://www.bart.gov/). Taxis, while available, aren't generally
necessary for getting around the city, which is only approximately 7 square
miles.

[Clipper Card](https://www.clippercard.com/ClipperWeb/) is the Bay Area's
transit pass. It works on many of the different public transit systems,
including SFMTA and BART. SFMTA one-way fare is $2.25 with a 90-minute transfer
(although sometimes you get a bit lengthier time for your transfer). BART fares
are based on distance. SFO to Civic Center Station is $8.65; OAK to Civic Center
Station is $10.05. See [BART's website](https://www.bart.gov/) for further fare
prices.

### Parking

Don't do it! Your best bet is public transit and/or walking; downtown streets
have one ways and can be very confusing. Street parking is horrible, and paid
parking is way expensive. But if you do drive, you may park at 355 McAllister
Street. The hours for this underground parking structure are 6 a.m. to midnight
M–F. Fees vary but $4.50 to $2.00 per hour depending on when you enter garage.

## How do I...

### Enter the building for the first time?

During business hours (6 a.m. to 6 p.m.), pass through security with your badge
visible. Your GSA ID grants you access to the building at any time during those
hours.

If you’re having trouble, call one of the points of contact listed above, or
give a shout in the #sf channel on Slack.

### Get my fingerprints and badge?

You can get them at 450 Golden Gate.
[Schedule an appointment online](https://timetrade.com/app/usaccess/workflows/usaccess001/schedule/location?wfsid=b07a7e11-baba97f6-b07a7e14-baba97f6-00000003-6ndldh7l376heqavd2983aah4s7tsj4b&appointmentTypeGroupId=hspd12&fs=1)
or call (415) 844-9759.

Once you’re there, turn right after entering past security, then the office for
the MSO Credentialing Center is directly across from IRS. This is also where you
can get your card _activated_.

### Attend GSA and TTS orientation?

GSA onboarding is typically conducted on Mondays at 50 UN Plaza. TTS SF
onboarding takes place after GSA orientation at our office suite. You should
receive an email confirming the times that you will meet with your team.

### Find out everything I need to know about working in SF?

Whether you're new at TTS and are joining the SF office or you're a long-time
TTS member relocating to SF, here's an office onboarding checklist for you:

- If you would like a locker, or if you need a keyboard and mouse/trackpad for
  working with the office monitors, please email <mailto:peter.rowland@gsa.gov>.
- Ask in the #sf channel for a person to give you a tour of the office so you
  know where to find the printer, kitchen, etc.
- Ask in the #sf channel to get added to the 18F SF mailing list and 18F SF
  calendar.
- If you'd like to get the GSA Region 9 email newsletter (such as notes about
  optional GSA staff events and trainings at 50 UN Plaza), ask the #sf channel
  for the link.
- If you use public transit to/from work,
  [set up your TRANServe card](#transit-subsidy).
- If you want to get notified about coffee/tea/lunch outings,
  [set up a `sfeats` Slack highlight](#food-and-coffee).

### Bring in one-time guests?

Meet your guests at the front security desk to escort them in. You are
responsible for your guests during their visit.

Be aware that IDs from
[a few states](https://www.dhs.gov/current-status-states-territories) are not
acceptable; see that page for the current list of "noncompliant states". For
these states, another issued picture ID is required (or they can just show a
passport).

Government staff and project partners are welcome to co-work in the office.
Please let the rest of the team know so that they can say hello!

If you would like to host a group from a non-government organization, please
coordinate with [Outreach]({% page "/outreach" %}).

### Host long-term guests?

You may host folks from other government agencies. As the host you are
responsible for access issues and for any requests. You will need to complete
[50 UNP Auth Form.pdf](https://github.com/18F/handbook/files/433703/50.UNP.Auth.Form.pdf)
using your own information and email it to
<mailto:50UNPBuildingServices@gsa.gov>. Please make sure you do this with
advance notice, since the building will need time to update the guards’ list of
approved guests. Once the form has been accepted, guests will be able to access
the building without an escort.

### Access the building after hours?

If you're based in SF and would like to regularly access the building after
hours (6pm-6am), fill out the
[50 UNP Security Access Card Application](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1KW2Vv11KYoZ70ajCQliPi3O11HanUXx_).
Have a supervisor ("Director") sign it for you, then take it to the Operations
Coordinator in the [Building Manager's](#helpful-contacts) office, located in
room 0651 in the Basement, which is open 8:00am - 4:30pm. You may also scan and
email the form to [Ahmed Mahdi](mailto:Ahmed.Mahdi@aleutmgt.com), the Operations
Coordinator. He'll send the form to the Golden Gate Security Office, and email
you once your application has been approved. You'll then need to go in-person to
his office to register your PIV card and choose an access code, which you'll be
able to use at the SW entrance to the building.

If you're a visitor arriving outside business hours, you'll need to arrange for
a TTS staff member inside the office to escort you.

### Book rooms for meetings?

The SF office has small team rooms. You can book other conference rooms using
[BookIt!]({% page "/getting-started/classes/gsa-internal-tools/#bookit" %})
Recommended rooms include Yuma and Carson City, because they are
videoconference-friendly.

Wireless works well in the beautiful courtyard, so work outside for a change!

### Access a printer?

Refer to
[our printer information document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ikw7kfeY10lnImZHN7zq5wNjaTRBdTPkZj4QG7-z3d0/edit#)
for more details.

### Get on the wireless?

The Wi-Fi network is "gsa-wireless". For type of security, choose "WPA2
Enterprise" and enter your ENT username and password.

The guest Wi-Fi network is "GSA-Guest". The password changes monthly. To get the
current password, type “GSA Wireless” into any room on Slack (eg. in a DM to
yourself) and the current password will pop up.

### Access GSA websites from inside the building?

First, make sure you’re on the gsa-wireless network, per the previous section.
If you can access other websites but not .gsa.gov websites, keep your laptop
open, go to the 4th floor, and you should suddenly be able to access .gsa.gov
websites. You can come back upstairs and the new settings will stick.
(Preposterous but true.)

### Charge my laptop or phone?

Many of the power strips turn off automatically, so if you plug in your device
but it doesn’t start charging, look for the small power button _next_ to the
power strip (it’s a little rounded rectangular switch).

### Adjust a standing desk?

Under the keyboard platform, you’ll find two levers. Compressing the right-side
lever allows you to modify the tilt and height of the keyboard platform.
Compressing the left-side lever causes the _entire_ desk to immediately drop, so
it’s wise to keep a hand on the rest of it and remove hot liquids and anything
valuable first.

### Close up if I'm the last to leave for the day?

If you're the last to leave your side of the office (north or south side), take
care of these things on your side:

- The fans are set to stay on until 6 pm. If you're leaving after 6 pm and the
  fans are still on, turn them off.
- Close the windows.
- Turn off the lights. (You just have to turn off the big overhead lights; there
  are some small lights along the walls and in the team rooms that we can't turn
  off.)
- Check the other side of the office if you have time.

## Where are the...

### Bathrooms

Men's and women’s bathrooms are just down the hall from the TTS office — walking
away from the elevator bays of the building, the men’s room is on the left, and
for the women’s keep going down the hall to just past the stairwell on the left.

There is an all-gender bathroom in the Nimitz Suite on the third floor (room
3198),
[at the southwest corner of the third floor map here](https://insite.gsa.gov/portal/category/532018).
The Nimitz Suite is
[a set of conference rooms named after an admiral](https://gsablogs.gsa.gov/gsablog/2014/05/16/a-closer-look-the-nimitz-suite/).

An all-gender bathroom is also available for limited hours on Tuesday through
Thursday in the Health Unit, which is in the basement. See the
<a href="#health-center">health center</a> section for further details.

### Supplies

If you need supplies, there are two supply drawers on the northern side of the
office. One has general office supplies, the other has electronics and computer
accessories. Feel free to take what you need to get the job done. The drawers
are self serve, and no one takes inventory. If you see something running low, or
are in need of something not already in the drawer, see the general
[Equipment]({% page "/equipment/" %}) page for ordering more.

### Batteries

There are rechargeable batteries throughout the office space. You will find them
plugged into sockets charging. Please replace the fresh ones you pulled out with
the dead ones for recharging and re-use by another employee.

### Cafeteria and snacks

There's a cafeteria located on the first floor, serving breakfast and lunch.
[Official hours](https://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/200155) (they say they close
at 2 pm, but they usually close down around 1:50 pm). The cafeteria has a good
salad bar.

There are machines in the basement area with snacks as well as soft drinks.

### Kitchen

To find silverware and dishes: go to the kitchen down the hall (the one with the
sink), look in the cabinets.

To find the refrigerators: There's one in the little kitchen room. There's also
one in the little "break room" behind the orange wall within our office area (on
the UN Plaza side).

What goes in the recycling, composting, and trash bins: The building's default
brown paper towels go in compost. For details on other items, see
[the recycle/compost/trash lists provided by SF's waste handling company](https://www.recology.com/recology-san-francisco/what-goes-where/).

### Postal mail

Incoming mail is delivered as needed. Outgoing mail should be taken to the
mailroom downstairs.

For incoming USPS mail, please use this address (otherwise USPS may return your
mail as undeliverable):

> U.S. General Services Administration<br/> 50 United Nations Plaza<br/> Suite
> 207, Room #5685<br/> San Francisco, CA 94102

For FedEx and UPS, please use the address as usual:

([Federal Fitness Center](https://www.federalfitnesscenter.com/)). To gain
access, you will need to sign up at 450 Golden Gate — there are drop-in hours
all day on Monday from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., or you can make an appointment.

There are men's and women's locker rooms with lockers and showers. You do not
need a gym membership to access these; they are available for day use (not

### Interior courtyard

The interior courtyard has Wi-Fi access so you can work outside!

### Transit subsidy

your Clipper travel. You will get a debit card (called a “TRANServe card”) which
you use to load your Clipper card each month.

See the [Transit Benefit]({% page "/transit-benefit" %}) page for information on
enrollment and deactivation. This
[page on InSite](https://insite.gsa.gov/topics/hr-pay-and-leave/benefits/transit-subsidy/transit-subsidy-program)
has additional information.

with lots of food and drink options near 50 UN Plaza.

If you’re looking for people to eat with or suggesting an outing, use the
keyword `sfeats` in {% slack_channel "sf" %}. (This is an alternative to
`@here`, which is intrusive for people who want to screen out those
notifications). You can also add that to your
