We actively work to eliminate bigotry and disrespect (e.g. microaggressions,
microinvalidations, etc.) from our workplace. We also understand that in order
to address
[unconscious bias](https://diversity.ucsf.edu/resources/unconscious-bias) you
have to start somewhere. Below are resources for anyone to learn more about
diversity and inclusion principles and best-practices:

- [18F Inclusive Language Guide](https://content-guide.18f.gov/inclusive-language/) -
  Principles, resources, and suggestions for writing and talking about diverse
  groups of people.
- [“Here’s EY's Simple But Effective Strategy For Increasing Diversity”](https://fortune.com/2017/02/10/ey-simple-effective-diversity-inclusiveness-strategy/) -
  Is something a preference, tradition, or requirement? This article covers how
  Ernst and Young used the “PTR” framework to hire a more diverse workforce. It
  can be used widely to critically assess all aspects of a work culture.
- [One on One Meeting Framework](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GAhgY2y1usPhU7UN-w08ZDNXFTC6aWBKFBYRRxgjvWk/edit) -
  This GSA resource -- though not explicitly written with a diversity and
  inclusion lens -- contains useful guidelines that supervisors can use to
  provide equitable feedback experiences with each employee on a regular basis.
- [Management Tools list from The Management Center](http://www.managementcenter.org/tools/) -
  Includes resources on delegation, roles & goals, performance problems,
  managing up, and much more. They include equity and inclusion considerations
  in their tools.
