_For reporting vulnerabilities, submit your report through the
[GSA Bug Bounty Program](https://hackerone.com/gsa_bbp)._

When someone in the public alerts GSA to a potential vulnerability in a TTS
system, we must act quickly.

GSA SecOps manages the shared
[GSA Bug Bounty Program](https://hackerone.com/gsa_bbp).

When a new vulnerability is reported through HackerOne using the
[GSA Bug Bounty Program](https://hackerone.com/gsa_bbp), HackerOne will triage
the submission. Once they have confirmed it is valid GSA SecOps will research
the report and then coordinate the response with TTS program technical contacts.

Use [#bug-bounty-partners](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/archives/C5JQCD9PH) to
communicate with GSA SecOps and HackerOne.
