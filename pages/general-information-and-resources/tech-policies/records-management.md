Records are written words, video recordings, etc. that are attributable back to
you. This page outlines how to properly treat federal records.

## Guidelines

All GSA employees are responsible for records management. The widespread use of
electronic mail ([GMail]({% page "/gmail/" %})) and electronic records through
GSA’s online applications has highlighted the need for everyone to understand
how to determine which documents are Federal records and how to manage them
effectively. Records serve a number of purposes, including:

- planning administrative and program needs
- documenting GSA activities
- protecting the agency's legal and financial rights
- providing for adequate oversight by Congress and other authorized agencies
- documenting the agency's history
- providing continuity of operations during an emergency or disaster

Records are critical to an organization to function effectively and efficient.
