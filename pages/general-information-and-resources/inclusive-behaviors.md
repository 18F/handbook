We believe there are four sources of inclusiveness at every organization, and we
work to align our organization to these principles.

**1. Organizational level:** Practices and activities that contribute to, or
detract from, an inclusive organization.

- The organization’s formal communications (mission statement, strategy, annual
  reports, etc.) reflect a commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion.
- DEIA are part of the core values of senior leadership, are treated as
  priorities, and are given enough resources.
- There are transparent and equitable processes around interviews, hiring,
  promotions, salaries, training approvals, and evaluations. Additionally, there
  are systems in place to regularly re-examine and remove any potential bias in
  these processes.
- There are clearly-communicated ways to support individual employees, including
  mentorship, development plans, and advancement opportunities.
- There is accountability and action when issues arise.

**2. Management:** The support you receive from your managers - this includes
program managers, leads, and/or supervisors.

- Your manager is reliable, ethical, and transparent.
- Your manager includes you in discussions, and you feel like an invaluable
  member of the team.
- Your manager models the importance of creating strong, supportive teams and
  regularly meets with every person 1-on-1.
- Your manager acknowledges the power dynamics that are created with managerial
  titles and does their best to make interactions more fair and balanced.
- Your manager creates an environment that feels safe for you to bring your
  whole self to work and upholds strong expectations that everyone else does the
  same.
- Your manager serves as an advocate and supports you in your professional
  growth.
- Your manager has challenging conversations when needed and approaches them
  with respect and empathy.
- Your manager is open to feedback.
- Your manager demonstrates that they care about diversity, equity, inclusion,
  and accessibility through words and actions.

**3. Work-group level:** Day-to-day interpersonal relationships and the team
climate.

- Your coworkers treat you as an insider to decision-making, respect your
  opinions, value you, and emphasize that you belong on the team.
- Your uniqueness is celebrated, and you do not feel the need to assimilate in
  order to fit in.
- You are treated as a valued participant to interpersonal and group learning.
- All roles and skill sets are valued, including “non-technical” ones.
- Space is intentionally made so that all voices are heard.
- Different ways of working and differing viewpoints are treated with respect.

**4. Individual level:** The contributions you make that affect inclusion and
awareness of diversity.

- You share decision making and power with your colleagues.
- You take the time to build relationships with colleagues on a personal level.
- You are mindful of your actions and words and take responsibility for the
  impact they have on others.
- You put in the work to educate yourself around subjects you are unfamiliar
  with before asking someone to educate you.
- You acknowledge your privilege and balance listening and supporting
  colleagues.
- You are an ally and use your voice to advocate for those who are overlooked or
  interrupted.
- You practice empathy and approach situations with curiosity rather than
  defensiveness — you try to understand where someone else is coming from.
- You recognize that it’s ok to disagree with others, and you practice
  respectful discourse.
- You treat yourself with kindness. Mistakes happen; you apologize and grow from
  them.
