title: Reasonable Accommodations
cSpell: ignore LRAC

---

A reasonable accommodation (RA) is a modification or adjustment to a job, a work environment, or a hiring process, based on a disability or medical condition.  

These modifications enable people with disabilities/medical conditions to have equal opportunity to get jobs and to successfully perform job tasks. RAs are not “special treatment.” They also often benefit all employees; for example, having captions appear during a meeting.

*This page provides guidance on how RA requests are processed at TTS. If you are applying to a role and are not yet a TTS employee, please follow the [applicant accommodations instructions](https://join.tts.gsa.gov/hiring-process/#:~:text=method%20of%20communication.-,Accommodations,-We%20want%20to) listed on JoinTTS.*

## Who is involved in the reasonable accommodation process?

There are three key people involved in the RA process:
- The requester (or a representative acting on the requester’s behalf)
- The requester’s supervisor
- TTS’ [Local Reasonable Accommodation Coordinator (LRAC)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15glvq9UakKUN8XTRTa6gRkhBHm2whhQyAGmf8ibTtBs/edit#heading=h.65ckjyv9pbpl)
  - The LRAC is responsible for overseeing all RA requests for TTS employees and providing training on the RA process. A more detailed description of the LRAC’s role and responsibilities can be found below. The requester and/or the requester’s supervisor can reach out to our LRAC at any time with questions.

## A note about short-term, minor needs

If you have a minor need that is expected to last less than 6 months, you do not need to go through the full RA process listed below. Your supervisor can approve your short-term request and should document their approval. 

## Submitting a reasonable accommodation request

An RA can be a verbal or written request. The request does not have to follow a specific format. 

The employee can make an RA request directly to their supervisor. If the direct supervisor is on an extended absence, the request can go to the second-line supervisor instead.

RA requests can also go to TTS’ [Local Reasonable Accommodation Coordinator (LRAC)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15glvq9UakKUN8XTRTa6gRkhBHm2whhQyAGmf8ibTtBs/edit#heading=h.65ckjyv9pbpl). However, contacting a direct supervisor is the most efficient method.

Employees can also have a family member, friend, healthcare professional, or another representative make the RA request on their behalf. If a more structured format is preferred, GSA has [Form 3676, Confirmation of Reasonable Accommodation Request (Appendix A)](https://www.gsa.gov/forms-library/request-reasonable-accommodation). *Please note, this form is **not** required.*

Note: If an employee makes a verbal request, their supervisor and/or the LRAC will send written confirmation that they received the request.

## Decision Makers (DM) for reasonable accommodation requests

The requester’s first line supervisor will be the decision maker (DM) for the RA request. 

In the event their direct supervisor is on extended leave, their second line supervisor can step in as the DM.

## How reasonable accommodations are reviewed

When the DM reviews a request, they focus on the requested change, not on a particular disability or medical condition. 

If the employee’s needs are unclear or there are challenges in meeting the request, the DM may schedule an interactive process meeting. “Interactive process” is the terminology used to describe how RA requests are collaborative: employers and employees work together on finding solutions.

During an interactive process meeting, the requester will meet with the LRAC and DM to discuss the needs outlined in the request and the essential duties of the position.

If the requested accommodation cannot be provided and no alternative accommodations are available, the burden will shift to GSA to demonstrate an undue hardship in meeting the request. 

## Confidentiality

There are strict confidentiality rules around medical information. 

Any supervisor who is involved in the RA process is required to keep **all types of  medical information confidential**. This includes general details (such as saying “that person is on medication”) and specific details (“that person has ADHD”). 

Any request for supporting medical documents will come from the LRAC, and the employee should submit the documents directly to the LRAC. Supervisors do not see or review your medical documents. For visible disabilities, medical documentation is typically *not* required. 

## Timeline on reasonable accommodation requests

The DM or LRAC will acknowledge all RA requests within three calendar days of receipt, and the DM will begin the interactive process within five calendar days of receipt. 

If the request does not require supporting medical documentation, the DM or LRAC will provide an RA decision as soon as possible, but not to exceed 30 calendar days from the request date, unless extenuating circumstances exist.

Requests that require supporting medical documentation are also subject to receiving a decision within 30 calendar days; however, the timeline is subject to extension. 

## Role and Responsibilities of the [LRAC](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15glvq9UakKUN8XTRTa6gRkhBHm2whhQyAGmf8ibTtBs/edit#heading=h.65ckjyv9pbpl)

1. Provides assistance to the requester and/or the requester’s supervisor on all RA requests.  Works with the DM to gather sufficient information in order to make an informed decision on the request. The DM considers:
  * Whether the requester is a "[qualified individual with a disability](https://www.opm.gov/frequently-asked-questions/employment-faq/disability-employment/who-is-a-qualified-individual-with-a-disability/#:~:text=A%20qualified%20individual%20with%20a%20disability%20has%20the%20skills%2C%20experience,with%20or%20without%20reasonable%20accommodation.)"
  * Whether the requested accommodation would be effective
  * Whether alternative accommodations would be effective
2. Assists the requester and DM with processing the RA request, including helping all parties complete the appropriate forms.
3. Ensures RA requests are routed to the appropriate person, are coordinated amongst appropriate offices, and are processed within the required timeframes.
4. Works with the DM to determine if medical documents are necessary. 
  * For visible disabilities, medical documents are typically not required. 
  * If the LRAC determines that medical documents are needed, the LRAC will request that information directly from the requester. The LRAC will only request medical information that is relevant to the RA request being made. The supervisor will not see the medication documents.
5. Coordinates prospective denials of RA requests.
6. Provides RA training to employees and supervisors, as needed. 


## Assistive technology available from TTS and GSA

### Screen Readers

**MacBooks**

If you receive a Mac, the [VoiceOver app](https://www.apple.com/voiceover/info/guide/_1121.html#:~:text=About%20VoiceOver,VoiceOver%2C%20press%20Command%2DF5) is already pre-installed. However, the application only activates after you login, so you may need to partner with your supervisor, onboarding buddy, or the onboarding team when logging in for the first time. 

**Windows/PCs**

If you receive a Windows PC, you can request the JAWS Screen Reader software via the [GSA IT Service Desk](https://gsa.servicenowservices.com/sp/). 

### Ordering additional tools

GSA has a [list of approved software](https://ea.gsa.gov/#!/itstandards) and an [IT Service Catalog](https://gsa.servicenowservices.com/sp/) where you can request software to be installed on your computer. If a piece of needed software cannot be found within the Service Catalog, the LRAC, in consultation with the DM, can help coordinate the purchase of additional software, assistive technology, and/or communication equipment as part of the RA process.  Supervisors can submit a [micropurchase request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd-GoOE9xWWfJvdZNRP3SE7mj5ysI_RfM8brxdG8YpyJV9yKA/viewform) for approved software that does not have GSA-wide licenses.


## Non-technology accommodations
 
An RA can extend beyond technical considerations. Below are common types of non-technology based accommodations.

### Assistive staff
Assistive staff includes, but is not limited to, [American Sign Language interpreters]({% page "/general-information-and-resources/employee-resources-policies/deaf-hoh/#asl-interpreters" %}) and/or readers. If current staff can provide an effective accommodation, the DM will consider that option. If not, the DM will request the assistance of TTS OA for procuring the necessary services.

Other common types of non-technology based accommodations include: 
- Modification of [work schedules]({% page "/general-information-and-resources/employee-resources-policies/work-schedules/" %})
- Allowance of breaks or approval of leave;
- Allowance of telework beyond that which is normally provided;
- Change how or when ‘non essential’ job duties are performed, and 
- Adjustments to GSA office space.

## Requests involving repeated services

For requests needed on a regular, recurring basis, such as assistance from an interpreter for a weekly staff meeting, the request will only need to be submitted and approved once. The supervisor will make the appropriate arrangements on an on-going basis, without requiring repeated requests.

For infrequent or one-off requests, the requester must give advance notice to their supervisor in writing (e.g. email) for each subsequent time the accommodation is needed.

## Transferring teams and going on detail

If you are transferring teams or going on detail (and you have an existing RA in place), you can reach out to TTS’ [LRAC](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15glvq9UakKUN8XTRTa6gRkhBHm2whhQyAGmf8ibTtBs/edit#heading=h.65ckjyv9pbpl) with questions about renewing/continuing your RA with a new supervisor. 

## Travel   

The employee will work with their supervisor and/or the LRAC on an RA request related to travel, following the same steps listed above. 

If your approved RA incurs extra travel expenses, email the TTS Travel team stating that the additional expense is part of an approved RA, and copy your supervisor on the email. Please do not provide any details about the RA; simply state that you have one and it is approved. The Travel team will upload a copy of the approval email into Concur.

## Instructions for supervisors receiving a RA request

If your direct report makes a verbal RA request, you are required to send a written confirmation to them via email letting them know that you’ve received the request. Please copy TTS’ [LRAC](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15glvq9UakKUN8XTRTa6gRkhBHm2whhQyAGmf8ibTtBs/edit#heading=h.65ckjyv9pbpl) on the confirmation email as well. There is no standard message format that supervisors are required to follow. **You must respond to the RA request within three business days, and initiate the interactive process of making a decision within five calendar days.**

When reviewing a request, supervisors should focus on the requested change, *not* on a particular disability or medical condition. 

If the requester’s needs are unclear or there are challenges in meeting the request, contact the LRAC and schedule an interactive process meeting. During this meeting, the requester, supervisor, and LRAC will have the opportunity to discuss the employee’s specific needs and the essential duties of their position.

If the requested accommodation cannot be provided and no alternative accommodations are available, the burden shifts to GSA to demonstrate an undue hardship that results in denying the accommodation.

For RA requests that require purchases, supervisors work with TTS Finance and/or the TTS Office of Acquisition (OA).

### Confidentiality for supervisors

There are strict confidentiality rules around medical information. 

Any supervisor who is involved in the RA process is required to keep **all types of  medical information confidential**. This includes general details (such as saying “that person is on medication”) and specific details (“that person has ADHD”). 

Any request for supporting medical documents will come from the LRAC, and the employee should submit the documents directly to the LRAC. Supervisors do not see or review medical documents. For visible disabilities, medical documentation is typically not required.
