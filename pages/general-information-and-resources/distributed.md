_Before you do anything, read our
[best practices for making distributed teams work](https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/10/15/best-practices-for-distributed-teams/)._

## How do I...

### Set up my computer?

TTS employees receive a MacBook and an iPhone from GSA, though you may not
receive your work phone on your first day.

On your first day at work you should configure things so that your two-factor
authentication (2FA) codes---which you'll occasionally need to connect to GSA's
virtual private network (VPN)---are delivered to your cell phone. If you don't
receive your work cell phone on day one, you'll need to use your personal phone.
**If you do not configure 2FA you will not be able to access your email from
outside of federal buildings.**

See the [Equipment page]({% page "/getting-started/equipment/#phone" %}) for
more about how to set up 2FA so you can receive GSA 2FA codes on your cell
phone.

### Get a one-time password?

To get a one time password (OTP, required for logging in to some systems), you
can either:

- Setup a
  [SecureAuth OTP Application](https://insite.gsa.gov/employee-resources/information-technology/do-it-yourself-self-help/telework-technology/secureauth).
- Visit [otp.gsa.gov](https://otp.gsa.gov).

### Visit another GSA building?

Your badge should work in other GSA buildings.
<a href="https://gsa-tts.slack.com/messages/@kathryn/">Kathryn Connolly</a> can
submit paperwork to get permission for you to enter the NYC, Chicago, or D.C.
buildings, which will take a few days. After you receive an email confirmation,
visit the security office in that new building to activate your card.

### Connect to the GSA network remotely?

See [Logging in &amp; Networks]({% page "/how-to-log-in/" %}) for details.

### Get my laptop repaired?

First, go to {% slack_channel "teamops" "Team Ops" %} for advice. They will
likely either ask you to take it to an Apple Store (TTS will pay for the
repairs), or ship it back to TTS (we'll ship you a new laptop).

### Tether to my GSA phone?

Apple's instructions [are here](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204023).

### What supplies do distributed employees receive?

GSA provides remote workers with a laptop and phone but does not provide
monitors, desk chairs, or office products.

### What advice do your distributed colleagues have?

From Peter Karman and Becky Sweger:

- **Invest in a decent set of headphones with a microphone.** It's often painful
  to have meetings with folks who rely on their laptop mics for audio: There are
  echoes, it's hard to hear, etc. Please try not to do that! Instead, get the
  kind that can plug into a laptop and your phone. These are an invaluable tool
  for long conference calls. Sennheiser's HD 219 headphones have worked for some
  of us.
- **GSA can also provide a wireless keyboard and a mouse.** If you're in need of
  extra equipment, just ask. Hop into {% slack_channel "equipment" %} on Slack.
- **A standing desk is critical for your health.** Folks in the
  {% slack_channel "distributed" %} channel are always happy to discuss their
  various standing desk hacks or purchases.
- **Make sure you can connect to the GSA network remotely.**
- **Assume people are working asynchronously.** We never assume that people are
  available the minute that we need them. We use the collaborative tools to
  communicate, which ensures all of our communication is documented and
  searchable for coworkers who might be checking on things later in the day.
  Writing everything down — even conversations we have verbally — ensures all
  team members are informed and up-to-date.

## Keeping in touch

- **Over communicate.** Working remote means you can't rely on your physical
  presence to communicate to everyone else whether or not you're "at work." For
  18F team members, use the
  [18F Out of Office (OOO) calendar](https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=gsa.gov_bth7useo0eeiicjgos2di6ph8k%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America/New_York)
  if you're assigned to an office and working remotely or if you're working in a
  different place than usual. On phone calls, don't be afraid to jump in and
  tell people if you can't hear.
- **Schedule (virtual) coffee with other TTSers.** People who work out of GSA
  offices will do this from time to time, and you should, too. Ask people out to
  virtual coffee/tea and get to know each other!

## Work-life balance

- **Know when enough is enough.** When you've done a good day's work, stop
  working! (advice from Michelle Hertzfeld)
- **Remember to set yourself as inactive on Slack and turn off Slack's phone
  notifications.** Setting yourself as inactive doesn't automatically stop the
  phone notifications, but doing both of these things will suppress
  notifications when you're not working.
- **Set boundaries early and often.** Remember that you can set your working
  hours in Google Calendar.

From **Julia Elman**:

> **MEET EVERYONE!** The TTS team is filled with amazingly kind and talented
> people. Don't be shy, and get to know everyone! Learn about what projects are
> going on, see what interests you, and go for it."
>
> **Schedule virtual teas with your colleagues** via Google Hangout, just to say
> hello. "You can also Hangout with colleagues and work on projects — sometimes
> it's just nice to see or hear someone," she says.

From **Greg Boone:**

> **Stay active!** Ride a bike or go for a walk every day. I try to hit the
> trails for about 40 minutes over lunch. It cuts into my sit-down-and-eat
> lunchtime but it's worth it to get away from my desk and refresh my view.
>
> **Get or convert an existing piece of furniture into a stand up desk.** Even
> if you don't use it all day, every day, having an alternative work surface can
> be really refreshing. Also, if you have a newish iMac at home, you can use the
> Thunderbolt port to turn it into a second monitor.

- Finally, make sure you get out and see other humans every once in awhile. It
  can be easy to feel like you're getting social interaction hanging out on
  Slack all day, but actually seeing humans who don't live in your house is also
  necessary.
