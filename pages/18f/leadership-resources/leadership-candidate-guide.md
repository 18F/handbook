This guide is meant to help anyone interested in applying for a leadership role
at 18F know what to expect and how to navigate the process.

So a new leadership opportunity has popped up and caught your attention? Great!
Or you see it and think one of your colleagues would be a great fit? Also great!
Read on for how to proceed.

Most of this document is geared towards people who apply or are nominated, but
hopefully this can help everyone understand the process. So maybe next time,
you’ll be the one applying!

## Nominations

All leadership role searches will have a deadline. That deadline should be a
minimum of five days and preferably longer. There should be enough time for
everyone to consider whether they want to apply or nominate a colleague and to
prepare their application materials. The deadline should be communicated clearly
in the announcement and on the nomination form. If you can’t find the deadline,
ask! The hiring manager or guild leaders should know, or the 18F Chief of Staff
can find out for you. If the deadline seems too short to allow for an inclusive
competition, please let someone know. In addition to the hiring manager, guild
leaders, or Chief of Staff, you can also talk to your team lead, supervisor, the
diversity guild, or the Talent team.

### Nominating yourself

When a role is announced, it should be accompanied by a nomination form that
will include asking for your name, a few words about why you think you’d be
successful in the role, and any additional notes you may want to add. If you
can’t find the nomination form, reach out to the hiring manager or guild leaders
(depending on the sort of role), or the 18F Chief of Staff.

When describing why you’d be successful in the role, try to link your
experiences with the job description, required tasks, skills and mindset, and so
on that are included in the role description. Be kind to and generous with
yourself when considering your experiences, and don’t sell yourself short! We’d
prefer you overestimate the relevance of your experiences for a particular role
than to underestimate yourself and deprive us of your leadership!

### Nominating someone else

When a role is announced, it should be accompanied by a nomination form in
Google Forms. That will ask for your nominee’s name, a few words about why you
think they’d be successful in the role, and any additional notes you may want to
add. If you can’t find the nomination form, reach out to the hiring manager or
guild leaders (depending on the sort of role), or the 18F Chief of Staff.

If you plan to nominate someone, consider the specific ways you believe the
person will be successful. You’ll also want to carefully review the role
requirements. You’re encouraged to tell the person you nominated them, and why
you believe they'd have a strong application. Even if they decide not to pursue
the role, people often find thoughtful nominations to be affirming.

## Evaluation

You should get a message shortly after the competition closes. It could take a
couple of days! If you were nominated by someone else, you’ll be asked if you’re
interested in the role. You’re not obligated to interview just because someone
nominated you, but if your colleagues believe you’ll be good for the role, you
are more than welcome to continue if you want! The evaluation process includes
an interview and looking at your nomination form. Everyone who applies or is
nominated and wishes to be considered will be considered before a decision is
made.

## Selection

After all of the interviews are finished, the interview panel will convene to
make a selection. You will be notified that interviews have finished and told
when the interview panel is meeting to decide. Once someone is selected, the
interview panel must first notify Talent. After Talent gives the final okay,
candidates can be notified. If you are selected, you will be contacted first so
you have the opportunity to decline the role. You may be asked not to announce
anything for a little while so everyone else can be notified privately first.

People who are not selected will be contacted and offered a debrief session with
the panel or a representative to discuss the areas for growth they identified.
You are not required to accept the debrief session, but you are encouraged! Not
being selected is not a personal failure, but a chance to get targeted feedback
on how to grow into a particular role.

Once everyone has been notified, there will be a public announcement from the
hiring manager or guild leaders.
