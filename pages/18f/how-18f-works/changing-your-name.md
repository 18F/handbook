TTS does our best to make everyone feel welcome. During the onboarding process,
we can't always ensure that your preferred name is reflected in all of GSA's
systems. You can update your records so that people who look at your name on
emails and in Google Meet are reminded to use the name that makes you most
comfortable.

## Changing your name across GSA

Follow these steps if your name in GSA systems does not match your name as it
appears on identity documents (e.g. passport, marriage certificate, state-issued
ID card):

1. Log in to the [GSA network or a VPN]({% page "/how-to-log-in/" %})
1. Follow
   [these steps](https://corporateapps.gsa.gov/files/HR-Links-Guide_-Changing-Your-Name_Final-Oct-2020docx.pdf).
1. Wait up to 5 business days for the changes to take effect. You will receive
   an automated email from HR links stating that it has been submitted.
1. Once your name has been updated in GCIMS via HRLinks, you can submit a GSA IT
   Help Desk to update your google account.

If you have trouble with this process,
[contact HRLinks support](https://corporateapps.gsa.gov/hr-links/hr-links-support/).

## Adding a preferred name

Follow these steps to add or update your _preferred_ first name, for example GSA
systems refer to you as Michael but you go by Mike:

1. Log in to the [GSA network or a VPN]({% page "/how-to-log-in/" %})
1. Log in to [GCIMS](https://gcims.gsa.gov)
1. Click on `GCIMS Self Service` on the left
1. Click on `Work Contact Information` close to the middle of the page
1. Enter your the name you go by in the Preferred Name field
