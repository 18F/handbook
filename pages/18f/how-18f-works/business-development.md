## Who We Are

The 18F Business Development team is responsible for identifying potential
partnership opportunities for 18F’s products and services. Specifically, the
team works to identify prospective work by fielding calls with partners,
tracking prospective leads, and qualifying work that aligns with 18F’s mission
and values.

## Business Development Process

- We model 18F’s collaborative and user-centered approach in the business
  development process.
- We host introductory conversations with potential partners in an effort to
  learn more about them and the problems they’re trying to solve.
- We have collaborative meetings with 18F’s Subject Matter Experts (SMEs)—a
  cross-functional team of product managers, acquisition specialists, designers,
  and engineers—to get a better sense of what partner(s) would like to achieve,
  and to qualify opportunities.
- We develop project proposals that translate what partners need into what 18F
  can deliver.
- We track and maintain potential leads in our internal partner relationship
  management tools.
