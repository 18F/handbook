One-to-ones are a foundational management tool. This guide provides a template
and detailed guidance on how to hold effective 1:1s. It’s written with
engineering leaders in mind -- supervisors, facilitators, and possibly
functional leads -- but likely could be applied, with tweaks, to other
situations.

The fundamental purpose of 1:1s is **to build a relationship**. Strong
relationships are the cornerstone of leadership: everything else we do becomes
easier when we have strong relationships. At TTS, 1:1s help managers fulfill our
mission of _servant leadership_: we can better help the people on our team when
we have a strong enough relationship that they feel comfortable asking for help.

There are many ways of holding 1:1s. As you practice, you’ll probably find a
format and style that fits you and your partner[^1]. Since getting starting
holding 1:1s can be daunting to people who haven’t done it before, this document
provides a model as a starting point. Here’s the basic model:

- Hold **half-hour 1:1s weekly**, and **never miss them** (rescheduling is OK).

- 1:1s are work meetings, so **have a consistent agenda**. A good one is: ten
  minutes for them, ten minutes for you, ten minutes to talk about the future.

- **The most important part of the agenda is your partner’s**. Let them lead the
  conversation, even if it means skipping whatever you’ve got on your agenda.

That’s the summary; the rest of this document goes into (much) more detail on
the [mechanics](#basic-mechanics),
[specifics of the agenda](#what-should-i-say-or-do-during-their-part), and
[further reading](#further-reading).

Finally, note that 1:1s are a tool, not the point in their own right. At the end
of this document there are few notes on
[alternate strategies](#alternate-strategies) for fulfilling the
relationship-building goals of 1:1s. Experimentation is in our DNA; please feel
free to use this as a starting point to find what works!

## Basic Mechanics

There are many ways you could conduct 1:1s; a good default is: weekly, half-hour
meetings, with a consistent agenda.

### Suggested cadence: Weekly

The most common successful cadence for 1:1s is to hold them **weekly**.

More important than the specific cadence, however, is this: **never cancel a
1:1**. You don’t need to be rigid about schedules -- it’s fine to reschedule --
but missing a 1:1 sends a very powerful message that your relationship with your
partner isn’t important. It is important -- it’s the most important -- so once
you’ve picked a cadence: stick to it[^2].

To new managers, or to managers new to 1:1s, weekly can seem like a lot, but
there are several reasons why weekly 1:1s tend to be the most effective:

1.  **The goal of 1:1s is building relationships, and that’s hard to do if you
    don’t speak frequently.** Think about the people you have really solid, good
    relationships with. I’ll bet most of them are people you talk to at least
    weekly, if not more. It’s very hard to build a relationship with someone you
    only see monthly. And, when you do hold less-frequent 1:1s, they tend to be
    much more filled with tactical work and leave little time for longer-term,
    goal-oriented work.

2.  **People think about their work in weekly chunks**. Quick: what did you work
    on two weeks ago? You probably have to check your notes or calendar, right?
    That meeting you held two Tuesdays ago is already a faded memory, isn’t it?
    We tend to think of our work in weekly chunks, so less frequent 1:1s miss
    pieces of our partner’s work. In effect, if you’re only meeting monthly,
    you’re “sampling” only 25% of a partner’s time. So, the less frequently you
    hold 1:1s, the more likely it is that you’ll miss important data.

3.  **1:1s are a foundation for offering feedback and coaching in a regular,
    structured environment.** If you are trying to work with someone on a
    specific issue, weekly is probably the longest you could possibly go between
    adjusting course. If you’re only able to help someone change course once or
    twice a month, they’ll go a lot longer down an ineffective path before you
    can help. (In fact, if you’re really getting into a solid feedback/coaching
    rhythm, you’ll probably find it even more effective to deliver feedback even
    more regularly and granularly. But, that’s a difficult and harder skill to
    develop, and starting with weekly is good practice for taking that next
    step.)

4.  **It’s a more effective use of your time**: you’ll tend to get interrupted
    much less if folks they’ll have their next 1:1 soon. Although scheduling
    them weekly seems like it’s a lot of time up-front, most managers find they
    end up getting time back overall by reducing interrupts.

### Suggested Agenda: 30 minutes, yours/theirs/future.

One-to-ones are meetings, and **effective meetings have agendas**. A common
mistake is to schedule 1:1s regularly, but not use the time effectively. Talking
about sports or the weather every week might help build a relationship, but
probably not a good _working_ relationship -- and, more importantly, it’s not a
valuable use of anyone’s time.

So, effective 1:1s should have an agenda. There are probably many different
effective agendas for 1:1s, including one suggested below, but first a few
principles:

1.  **Your partner should own the agenda, not you.** That is, their needs trump
    yours. This doesn’t mean you’re off the hook to plan and manage the time,
    but it does mean that you should expect your partner to bring their own
    items to discuss, and to prioritize their requirements over yours. After
    all, you can always ask them for more time if you’ve got specific things to
    work on. There’s a delicate push-pull here: you want to make sure this
    meeting is valuable to them, but you also have a responsibility to keep
    things on-track and on-topic. So let them drive the agenda… but steer things
    back towards work if they go too far off-topic.

2.  Consistency is good, so **strive to follow the same agenda week-to-week**.
    This helps make 1:1s a comfortable, familiar place, and that in turn helps
    make it easier for your partners to bring up difficult topics. And, a goal
    of 1:1s is to gather data about how your team is doing, and if you follow a
    consistent agenda it’ll be easier to notice when things change (and ask
    about it).

    Some managers (I’m one) like to kick off the 1:1 with the same exact words
    each week, just to sort of signal the entrance to the 1:1 space. Some
    examples: “How are you?” “How’s it going?” “What’s on your mind?” “How’d
    last week go?”

    Along the same lines, you may want to end each meeting with a similar,
    consistent question. For example, Holly ends every 1:1 I’ve had with her
    with “How can I help you this week?” Questions like this help make sure any
    pressing needs are covered, and acts as a good bookend to the starting
    question – it signals that official 1:1 time is now over.

3.  **Good 1:1s should cover not just the short-term, tactical work, but also
    longer-term goals**. 1:1s aren’t just status updates (if you need regular
    status updates, do that separately); they’re about supporting people’s work
    in a complete way. This means that you’ll often talk about the day-to-day,
    but that you also need to make sure you come back to long-term goals and
    support them.

Here’s a good starting point for an agenda: **30 minutes, first their agenda,
then yours, then talk about the future**. In other words: open the 1:1 with
whatever your partner wants to discuss, then move into anything on your agenda,
and finally close by talking about any long-term work or goals y’all are working
on together. Ten minutes for each is a fine rough guideline, though holding to
this rigidly isn’t important -- it’d be weird to say “OK, your ten minutes are
up, moving on”. This is a good template for a few reasons:

- It puts the partner’s agenda first, which emphasizes the importance of their
  items, and ensures that if anything is especially “meaty” you can spend more
  than the suggested ten minutes talking through their stuff. In practice you’ll
  probably find that many weeks you spend the entire time on their agenda -- and
  that’s OK. That’s why we put it first!

- It speaks to the “shared” nature of the meeting: it’s primarily your partner’s
  agenda, but you’ll typically have some things to cover, too, so it reminds
  both of you to move on to that.

- It reminds you to spend some time on the long view, rather than just the
  day-to-day. In practice, it’s rare to talk long-term goals every week -- long
  term work takes time, and doesn’t often change week-to-week. So, most weeks,
  you can end early. But, having the long-term on the standing agenda helps
  remind both of you to revisit it when needed.

Again, there are probably many different effective agendas for a 1:1, but this
format is simple, flexible, and hits all the goals laid out above. Any good
format will probably include these three things, perhaps in a different
arrangement or format.

More details on each of those “three parts” follows:

## What should I say or do during “their part”?

Generally: not much! Most of the time, you’ll just want to **listen and
[take notes](#taking-notes)**. This doesn’t mean be completely quiet: you’ll
want to ask follow-ups, make sure you understand, and signal that you’re
following along (a.k.a.
[_active listening_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_listening)). But most
of the time during this part you should be listening, not talking.

You do want to try to steer things towards work. Small talk is fine: remember,
you’re building a relationship, so some chit-chat about weekend plans is totally
OK and normal. But this is also work-time, so you should try to gently steer
things towards work eventually.

Finally, be aware of the difference between a vent and a problem. Sometimes,
people will come to the 1:1 just needing to complain or get something off their
chest. In these cases, listening, asking questions, and making sure they feel
heard is all you need to do. But other times, there’s a problem to be solved,
and in those cases you’ll want to talk through solutions, suggest directions,
and steer towards action. Telling the difference is an art -- and in practice
there’s more of a spectrum than a solid line -- and you’ll get better with
practice and as you build that consistent personal relationship. Once you spot
the difference more clearly, it’ll be easier to know how to respond.

## What should I say during “my portion” of the meeting?

First, it’s fine if you don’t get to this every week -- or even most weeks!
After all, if your partner is constantly coming to 1:1s with meaty topics that
take all the time, that stuff’s probably well worth the time. And, you can
always ask your partner for more time, and they’ll rarely say “no”.

As for the specifics of your agenda: much of the time you’ll have an idea of
what you need to discuss based on whatever’s going on for you and your partner.
That said, here are a few ideas of things you might want to think about
discussing:

- **Follow-ups** on actions/tasks from previous 1:1s: if either of you had
  actions/tasks that came out of your previous 1:1(s), it’s a good idea to
  follow-up on them and see where they stand. This is another reason why
  [taking notes](#taking-notes) is useful: it’ll help you remember to check in
  on actions as appropriate.

- **“Current Events”**: after major announcements, or big changes, or any sort
  of “large” event in the organization at large, following up at the next 1:1 is
  a good idea. Most people need a bit of time to process change, and they’ll
  appreciate being able to talk through how it affects them in a private
  setting. If you’ve built a good relationship, it can be the only place where
  someone feels comfortable raising concerns. And, if there’s some action people
  need to take, they’re going to be much more likely to get it done if you
  reinforce the request by following up individually.

- **Feedback**: this is a big topic, more than can be covered here. That said,
  1:1s are a great time to deliver feedback. Indeed, a major reason to have
  regular 1:1s is to build the relationship and space where delivering feedback
  is easier.

- **Coaching/mentoring**: if you’re working with someone on an ongoing basis,
  helping them learn or work on new skills, your weekly 1:1 is a great time to
  check in on goals, discuss progress, provide pointers on direction, etc.

- **Question of the Week**: some managers like to have prepare a “question of
  the week” that they ask in all their 1:1s. Sometimes this can help with the
  “data collection” part of management, or it can just prompt discussion. There
  are some great resources in the [_Further Reading_](#further-reading) section
  below that can help provide potential topics, or you can of course bring your
  own.

Of course, these are just starting points. As you practice and build your
relationships, you’ll find what works best for you and the folks you meet with.

## What to cover during the “future” part of the agenda?

In practice, most people don’t get to this part every week, or even every-other
week. Long-term goals are, well, long-term -- so it’s rare for there to be much
motion week-to-week. Still, it’s a good idea to keep this on the agenda every
week: it’ll help you remember to focus in on long-term goals regularly, and make
sure you’re helping your partner make progress towards those goals.

Long-term discussions tend to be most closely like coaching or mentorship
discussions: the model that seems to work best is to ask your partner for their
goals, and help keep them accountable to those goals. If you have specific
guidance on how to achieve those goals you can of course offer it, but it’s far
more likely that your role will be more about tracking and gentle prodding.

For example, say you’re working with someone who expresses an interest in
learning Go. The discussion might go something like this:

> Them: I’d like to learn Go in the next few months.
>
> You: Oh, that sounds great. What’s your first step going to be?
>
> Them: I think I’ll work through the online Tour of Go, use that as a starting
> point
>
> You: That sounds good, when do you want to aim to get that done by?
>
> Them: Well, this week is pretty busy, so maybe by the end of next week?
>
> You: Great, good luck! I’m sure if you run into trouble you could ask someone
> in \#go for help.

_\[two weeks later\]_

> You: Hey, how’d the Tour of Go exercise go?
>
> Them: Pretty good, I got about 90% of the way through.
>
> You: Cool, was that enough? Or are you planning on doing the last 10%?
>
> Them: Nah, I think I’m ready to try a real project with it.
>
> You: Great, do you have any projects yet?

_\[and so forth...\]_

The thing about long-term goals is that it’s easy to not make any progress on
them. It’s far too easy to push off long-term personal improvement when faced
with the day-today. So -- somewhat counterintuitively -- in order to be really
supportive you do need to push a bit. Of course, you don’t want to be _too_
pushy, but it’s completely fine to ask for goals and gently hold people
accountable to the goals they set.

## Taking notes

**You should take notes during your 1:1s.** Notes will make sure you remember to
follow up on items that came up a long time ago. They’ll help you notice trends
and themes, and to be precise about them (“hey, we’ve talked three times in the
last month about some issues with Project X, what’s going on there?”). Notes can
also help you follow-up on progress week-to-week. Finally, if you do get into
the unpleasant situation of having to deal with a performance problem, your
notes will be critical to helping you document how you’ve been addressing that
problem.

While it’s true that taking notes can sometimes get in the way of a 1:1 feeling
truly conversational, remember that 1:1s are meetings too, and effective
meetings have notes. The specific format for notes don’t seem to matter much.
Some people prefer to take notes by hand, others digitally; and, of course,
there are tons of different ways to take and organize notes, be they analog or
digital.

It’s probably a good idea to keep all of the notes from each person’s 1:1
together in the same place (rather than scattered throughout a notebook, say).
That way you can easily review all your notes on past meetings, and pull out
trends like “hm, they’ve mentioned feeling overworked the last three times we
met.”

One (digital) pattern that many have found to be effective is the shared running
notes document. This is a shared document (e.g. a Google Doc) that both parties
have access to, and that contains both notes from previous 1:1s and a running
agenda for the next one. This lets either person drop items into the agenda
during in between meetings. It also emphasizes that the agenda is a shared
responsibility, and many like the transparency this sharing brings. You may
still occasionally want to (or need to) take private notes, but that’s fairly
rare.

Another pattern that some find effective is to send out a summary email after
the meeting is over, listing any actions that were agreed to during the meeting.
This can provide a shared sense of accountability to anything that you decide
during the meetings.

  — suggested conversation starters for 1:1s (and group meetings, too),
  collected by the Engineering chapter.

## Alternate strategies

As noted in the introduction, 1:1s are _a_ tool (and a common one), but not
necessarily the _only_ tool. If they’re not working for you or your partner, you
should feel free to explore alternate strategies. Exploring alternate strategies
completely is beyond the scope of this already-long document, but here are a
couple of quick “sketches” about some alternatives that might be worth trying:

- Small group meetings, such as the facilitation groups, can be more effective
  support structures for certain kinds of problems (you can see this overlap in
  the
  [_Topics for Engineering Facilitator Meetings_](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_NKx-zMwYqBqV48k062j4X2zdhKdYUgYlnM3wMpn5p8/edit#heading=h.oqzmgpl64nct)
  document linked above). They can encourage the creation of a wider
  relationship support network than just 1:1, and can provide a more diverse set
  of options than a single person can. Conversely, it can be harder to share
  certain kinds of problems with a larger group than with a single person --
  it’s probably harder to build the same level of trust with 5-7 people as with
  a single one.

- I have a friend who’s a VP at a manufacturing plant. She doesn’t hold 1:1s
  with her staff, but instead “walks the floor” every day and meets with each of
  them, quickly, to discuss the day’s goals, problems on the floor, and such. If
  something big comes up, they’ll schedule more time later in the day/week. In
  effect, she replaces a longer weekly 1:1 with usually much shorter (3-5
  minute) daily individual check-ins.

  The mechanics of a “walk the floor” model would be different on a distributed
  team, but it seems likely that a similar model could be replicated with Slack
  taking the place of “walking the floor”.

[^1]:
    Throughout this document I use the term “partner” to mean “the person with
    whom you’re holding the 1:1”. This replaces the stuffy and more
    Management-ese term “direct” that many 1:1 guides use, and emphasizes that
    at TTS, the person you’re holding 1:1s with may not formally report to you.
    And even if they do, you’re more likely to be in a servant-leadership role
    than in a command-and-control settings.

[^2]:
    Vacations are an exception: if one of you is going to be gone for a week,
    obviously don’t intrude on vacation to hold meetings! But they’re basically
    the only good reason to completely cancel (rather than reschedule) a 1:1.
