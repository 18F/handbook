Buying something over $10,000 means that the Office of Acquisition (OA) needs to
be involved in the process. A warranted Contracting Officer (CO) will help you
through the process and get you what you need. This guide will get you started
on how to work with OA and explain the steps you will take throughout the
process.

## Acquisition guide

### 1. Submit an [Intake Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdqd8GVxwJAGqwtEUJJ5rXtHZDMc9yLdGRUkp0tSkc4lwHhqw/viewform)

- Things you should know before submitting the Intake Form:
  - We will need funding for the buy in the form of a PR or a
    [memo](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tayJSTcge_jUEM7BWQvX2Tw_oexv6XhecTkJsawGknw/edit)
    stating funds are available.
  - Start thinking about who should be the Contracting Officer Representative
    (COR) on the project, someone to help manage the buy. They will need to be
    [FAC-COR](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HzbEv6yQn6pWYl1MDImeLW6ShedcRsekSCBe54Nsnc8/edit#heading=h.aizxbe137goh)
    certified.
  - If your request is for a software, please note that it is your
    responsibility to you get an Authority to Operate (ATO) or Fedramp
    Authorization. GSA IT asks technical and security questions, and you are
    probably the best POC to answer them. The steps to find or get an ATO is
    outlined in [TTS
    Handbook-Software-ATO]({% page "/general-information-and-resources/software/#software-not-yet-approved-or-listed-in-gear" %})
    section.

### 2. Intro meeting

- If your request has been accepted, OA will contact you within 3 business days
  of submitting the intake form to introduce you to your CO, the person who will
  do the buying for you.
- The CO will need to better understand your needs, timeline, concerns, etc.

### 3. Define requirements/market research

- We want to work together to clarify what it is you need and check the
  marketplace to see how it is being offered.

### 4. Preparing the pre-award acquisition package

- You and the CO will work together to build the acquisition package. The
  package includes a mix of internal documents and external documents. Internal
  documents help with planning, justifications, etc. External documents will be
  shared with the public, so the vendor community knows exactly what we are
  looking for. Documents that can go in a pre-award acquisition package are:
  - Statement of Work (SOW)/Performance Work Statement (PWS)/Statement of
    Objectives (SOO)
  - Market Research Report
  - IGCE
  - Specific Justifications-if applicable (Brand Name or Time & Materials/ Labor
    Hour Contract Type)
  - Acquisition Plan
  - Request For Quote (RFQ)
  - Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP), if applicable

### 5. Posting the solicitation

- We documented what we need and what is required per federal and agency
  regulations, so now we can post it to the public and see who can deliver!
- The COs have several venues where we can post our RFQ and supporting
  documentation: [GSA ebuy](https://www.ebuy.gsa.gov/),
  [FedBizOpps](https://www.fbo.gov/), and/or [Github](https://github.com/). The
  CO will be responsible for this action.

### 6. Evaluations

- Hopefully, we received interest from industry and have multiple responses from
  the vendor community. We will then review each quote from the vendors and
  evaluate in accordance with the evaluation criteria stated in the RFQ.
- We document our technical evaluations for each submitted quote and prepare a
  summary report.
- Typically, the CO will conduct the price analysis to make sure the apparent
  awardee’s quote is fair and reasonable.

### 7. Award prep

- At this time, we should have an idea who provides the best value to the
  government and will receive the award. We document this decision in the award
  decision memo.

### 8. Award

- The CO will use GSA’s contract writing system, ITSS, to make the contract
  award and receive the signed form by both the government and contractor) with
  the official contract number (Procurement Instrument Identifier).

## Post award guide

### CORs (Contracting Officer Representatives)

- Congratulations on the award, but the fun has just begun! It is the
  government’s responsibility to monitor the contractor’s performance to ensure
  the contract’s articulated outcomes are being achieved. In addition to
  monitoring the contractor’s performance, other post-award tasks may include:
  managing vendor/government relationships, issuing technical direction,
  reviewing and approving invoices, writing inspection/performance reports,
  tracking payments to indicate the remaining balance of funds, etc.

- We assign a COR, most likely from the customer’s team, to aid in the
  post-award contract management through a COR delegation letter.

- We have
  [guides and resources](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tSIiw6Jgfpx1OATIBKSXhQf90st1raeQ)
  to help the COR with fulfilling their responsibilities.

### Contract modifications

- Once your contract is awarded, it’s possible that you may need to modify the
  contract to reflect in-scope changes. Please note that only your Contracting
  Officer (CO) can modify the contract in two ways: unilaterally (the government
  CO signs) or bilaterally (the government CO and contractor sign).

- Here are some of the potential modifications we could make to your contract:

  - Administrative Modification (ie. New CO or COR)
  - Period of Performance Extension
  - Exercise of Option Period and/or Optional Services
  - Incrementally Fund Time & Material (T&M)/Labor Hour (LH) CLIN
  - Change Order/Supplemental Agreement for work within scope

- If you have a modification that needs to be made to your contract please fill
  out this
  [contract modification form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSem56QHnAqOiUYlGltNIFugRtWn_QAA43L_LGF0-jK3p5Q-kw/viewform)
  as soon as you know the modification is necessary and your CO will contact you
  right away.

### Contractor Performance Assessment Report (CPARS)

- For contracts over the simplified acquisition threshold (currently $250,000),
  the government is obligated to evaluate contractor performance. This
  evaluation will happen at the end of each Period of Performance (PoP). The CO
  will initiate the CPARS form and route it to you to evaluate the work of your
  contractor. Performance information should be entered directly into the CPARS,
  the Governmentwide evaluation reporting tool. Instructions for submitting
  evaluations into CPARS are available at
  [https://www.cpars.gov](https://www.cpars.gov/). After you submit the
  evaluation, it will go to your contractor POC for review. The evaluations are
  automatically finalized after 14 days, including any comments the contractor
  add to the review. This may sound overwhelming, but kindly note that your CO
  will guide you through the entire process. Please contact your CO if you have
  any questions.

### Contract close out

After all work under a contract has been delivered, it is time to close out the
contract. To initiate the contract closeout process, your CO will ask you for a
final report of the services and/or products received and the contractor’s final
invoice. The CO will also confirm with the OCFO that all payment has been made
to the contractor. Generally, a contract will be considered complete after the
CO receives this information and your CO prepares a contract completion
statement. After your CO marks the contract closed in the contract writing
system, the contract is officially closed and you are finished. On to the next!
