_This control document outlines how 18F conducts business._

## Why we enter into Interagency Agreements

18F provides digital and digital-related services to federal agencies. 18F is
funded by the
[Acquisition Services Fund](https://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/150047), which
requires reimbursement in full. We therefore charge our clients — the federal
agencies who engage us for project work — for our actual time and material
costs, plus a fixed overhead amount. To do so, we enter into an [interagency
agreement]({% page "/agreements" %}) (IAA), with each of our clients.

## Roles and responsibilities

In addition to software developers, designers, and other skilled positions,
every project team has a project lead and an account liaison. (In most cases,
both roles are played by the same person.) 18F also has an accounts manager and
a timekeeping manager.

For each project, the project account liaison and the 18F accounts manager,
together with client agency representatives, develop an IAA to be executed by
the authorized officials at GSA and at the client agency.

## How we draft and execute IAAs

18F drafts all of its IAAs using the
[FMS standard 7600A and 7600B forms](https://www.fiscal.treasury.gov/fsreports/ref/fincMgmtStdzn/fincMgmtStdzn_home.htm),
with attachments as necessary. Each IAA we draft is based on a standard set of
[18F IAA template documents](https://drive.google.com/a/gsa.gov/folderview?id=0B_BrYqdsWSajTUw0dVhhemRPQjQ&usp=drive_web),
initially developed and continuously updated jointly by 18F and the GSA Office
of General Counsel (OGC). [Learn more about the
process]({% page "/agreements" %}).

The form 7600A represents an umbrella agreement and sets the general terms and
conditions between GSA and the client agency. Each form 7600B is a task order
and includes a specific period of performance, an amount of money to be
obligated by the client for the project, and a Statement of Work specifying what
18F will do for and with the client.

All our IAAs are fully reviewed and approved by OGC before final signature by
the authorizing program and funding officials at GSA.

## When we begin working with the client

Before we draft and sign an IAA with a potential client, 18F usually spends a
few hours meeting with the client to determine whether 18F is a good fit for
their needs and whether the client is amenable to 18F’s methods, and, if there
is alignment, to develop the agreed-upon scope and objective(s) of the project.

After this [de minimis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_minimis) business
development time, 18F does not begin work for any agency client until an IAA is
signed by both GSA and that agency. The IAA specifies a period of performance,
which usually starts on the date of last signature of the parties; 18F begins
work with the client on or after that day.

## The client reviews our work continuously

18F is committed to remaining continuously accountable to its clients. The terms
of all our IAAs explain that we confer with all our clients at least every two
weeks, pursuant to standard agile development methodology. The client is
therefore continuously apprised of the status of, and involved in deciding the
future direction of, the project.

Our IAAs also allow both 18F and the client to terminate the IAA unilaterally on
30 days’ notice, at which point the client can de-obligate any funds not billed
prior to termination.

## Billing

Per the terms of all our IAAs, we invoice quarterly. We also account monthly for
all costs incurred (and to be billed) for each project. The monthly accounting
separately indicates labor charges (the predominant cost), web hosting and
infrastructure charges, and other/incidental costs. The purpose of the monthly
accounting is to provide each client with a sense of whether 18F is on track to
charge more or less than the obligated amount for the performance period of the
task order, so that the client can adjust the obligation accordingly if they so
choose.

## Closeout

The terms of all our IAAs describe the closeout process. When an IAA ends,
either because the performance period has expired or because one of the parties
terminates the agreement, we provide a final accounting of project costs to the
client, close the account, and return any remaining funds so that the client can
de-obligate them.

## Timekeeping

All 18F employees report their hours weekly. They account separately for
billable and non-billable hours, and account separately for their work on each
project.

Timekeeping is monitored by the timekeeping manager, who verifies weekly that
everyone has reported their time for the previous week and directly contacts
employees who have not done so.
