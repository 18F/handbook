Research isn’t only usability testing. Testing our assumptions by actively
engaging with the world around us is at the heart of how TTS works. We do
research when we meet with stakeholders to learn about a project, when we
investigate and compare tools and systems, and when we find members of the
public to tell us about their experiences with the federal government. Research
can include questionnaires and surveys, as well as analytics.

These guidelines should be familiar to anyone who's done research in the private
sector or in academia. However, as public servants, we need to make sure that
we're following a few basic principles.

- **Respect**: We honor people's opinions and choices, only blocking actions
  that are obviously going to harm others. We make sure that anyone
  participating in our research is doing so of their own free will, and that
  they have enough information to make that decision responsibly.
- **Beneficence**: We do our best to further people's best interests, and we
  avoid actions that might hurt them. This goal extends to society at large:
  before doing research, we need to consider whether what we're doing is in the
  best interests not just of individual participants but of the organizations
  and the country that we serve.
- **Justice**: We do our best to ensure that we compensate research participants
  in some way for the time and energy that they contribute. We don't have to pay
  money, but we do have to give something back to participants. Sometimes that
  means just saying "thank you" and letting them know how much their input has
  helped improve government services. Other times, it can mean making a card or
  handing out cookies or fruit. Participation incentives, which are common in
  the private sector, are more tricky here in government. So please ask one of
  the Research Guild leaders if you think they're necessary for a specific
  study.

While only scholarly researchers are strictly obligated to follow these
principles, they are widely accepted in the United States as
[a set of overarching values](https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/belmont-report/index.html#xethical)
guiding all investigations involving humans.

This document explains two main tasks we do to operationalize our basic
principles: informing and getting consent, and managing personally identifiable
information (PII).

## Informing and getting consent

TTS researchers have an obligation to ensure that our participants know what it
means to participate in our research and how we plan to use the information we
collect. Before getting consent, ensure participants understand:

1. They cannot expect to receive compensation for their participation (unless
   otherwise agreed to with our agency partners — note that this is a legal
   issue!)
1. The types of information we may record (this could be name, direct
   quotations, photos, screen captures, etc.)
1. How we will share information we collect. Usual options include: No one ever
   (off the record), within the immediate project team, on a need-to-know basis
   (our default), and with the general public.

### Getting consent

TTS gets explicit consent from anyone who participates in our moderated
research, generally by asking that our research participants sign a "design
research participant agreement". TTS maintains a
[template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16qg58Hn92UlXLsi-2taizi7qe5mvQ3LMSkcvyHk8Bdo/edit)
for internal use, and an
[example participant agreement](https://methods.18f.gov/participant-agreement/)
for sharing with interested parties. Please make a copy of the participant
agreement document template, put it into your project folder, and edit the
highlighted text for each of your research studies. If your participants are
likely not fully literate in English, consider having the form translated to the
correct language or working out a process for verbal consent using a translator.

When sending participant agreements electronically, please use our
[participant agreement email template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1t01t_eLYWJXuKdJkhiyBqkWf4Yr5XsFAbNv-BDAZqzE/edit).
This template clearly specifies how people can opt out of a study and/or request
that we do not contact them in the future.

## Compensating user research participants

### Background

As long ago as 2012 for PIFs and 2014 for 18F, the idea of paying for users to
provide feedback has been discussed in depth. Our teams attempted to incentivize
users to participate in our tests with gift cards or pizza or even payment to
attend. This model implicated a number of appropriations law issues, among other
regulations-based issues, that resulted in the concept of paying for user
testing being rejected. So while we _could_ conduct user research, we weren’t
able to _compensate_ users until relatively recently.

Fortunately, we have made a lot of progress in developing approved processes for
compensating research participants. We will continue to update this page as we
streamline and refine our practices.

### Should I compensate research participants?

In general, if you are conducting research with members of the public, you
should compensate them for their time and expertise. Offering compensation is
critical to reaching the people most in need of government services. It helps
ensure that we are gathering feedback and input from diverse audiences to
develop and improve our products and services. It makes it easier to recruit
participants, especially from underserved communities, and helps build trust.
Without providing incentives and compensation, we are likely to hear only from
the people who can afford to volunteer their time.

### Who is not eligible for compensation?

There are exceptions when it comes to financial compensation. Federal government
employees, paid NGO staff, and private company employees being interviewed or
participating in research activities as part of their paid duties are typically
not eligible for compensation. Additionally, state, local, tribal and territory
government employees are likely not eligible. You should work directly with your
participants to understand any restrictions on financial compensation or other
relevant rules and regulations.

In addition to paying participants, there are other ways to recognize the value
of participants’ knowledge and experience. These can include:

- Opportunity to provide feedback on design over time
- Resources for additional information on the topic
- Offer to find out answers to questions they may have
- Whenever possible, share the outcomes of the research

### What authorization and approvals do I need?

**TTS User Research Participant Compensation Justification Checklist:** Each
project team must document their need to compensate user research participants
by creating a justification for user research
[template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15SxB0JCi-OvTD2lLokkuixb9sWuu1i2v-K8wGhPqcno/edit).
Teams can use this
[sample justification](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dNxmqlvtTwFbVBnypsVqA4rU2aNS1oXA1k4tmWLSwUw/edit#heading=h.qgqf6gne4pg0)
for reference. Teams do not need to submit this justification, but they must
keep a copy in the
[user research compensation justifications folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0AGmTTInlTCCQUk9PVA).

The justification answers the following questions:

- Does this work directly advance GSA’s or the client’s statutory mission and
  objectives?
- Does the benefit to the government outweigh the benefit to the individual?
- Has the agency attempted to accomplish its goals through means other than paid
  user research?

**Interagency Agreement (IAA) Attachment B - User Research Compensation
Authorization:** Additionally, this approved attachment
[template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ehb3W14_eEo8DdHjU0bCeyzG_t8I__7VyLV_cU4ZmQY))
must be part of your project’s IAA (if you have one). If it is not, work with
your account manager to get it signed by an authorized official at the partner
agency.

The partner’s OGC will need to provide TTS a concurrence that “the benefit
accruing to [the requesting agency] in obtaining this feedback outweighs the
personal nature of this expense. [The requesting agency] has also determined
that the feedback from this user research will directly advance the statutory
mission and objectives of [the requesting agency]."

### How much compensation should I offer?

While TTS is working to standardized base rates, the IAA
[Attachment B - User Research Compensation Authorization](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ehb3W14_eEo8DdHjU0bCeyzG_t8I__7VyLV_cU4ZmQY)
sets a rate of $70 an hour for moderated research sessions. From 2020 research
on third-party recruiters, the median range was between $50 to $70 per person
per hour (this does not account for recruiting expenses an organization might
incur). Recruitment and support averaged about $125 per participant, which means
that the total cost for a moderated session would be about $195 per person.

In 2022, TTS considers $70/hour as a starting point for compensation. Teams
should consider factors of equity and complexity of the research when
determining compensation for user research on their project.

### How do I actually distribute the compensation to research participants?

There are a few different ways to distribute compensation to research
participants.

**Pay participants via gift card:** Compensation can be distributed to
participants via digital/e-gift or physical gift cards through
[GiftBit](https://www.giftbit.com/). Gift cards can be purchased by submitting a
[purchase card request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd-GoOE9xWWfJvdZNRP3SE7mj5ysI_RfM8brxdG8YpyJV9yKA/viewform).
The total amount of the purchase must be under $10,000 per project.

For more information, see [how do I complete a micropurchase
request?]({%page "/office-of-acquisition/#how-do-i-complete-a-micropurchase" %})
in the handbook.

**Use usertesting.com:** Teams can also use usertesting.com, if that’s
applicable. TTS currently has a no cost agreement for that service (with help
from a third party vendor)
[per instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zJuzKW1txg73ukZlFF37vp5RRhf-iR0r2QZzs0-MXY8/edit).

### Step-by-step checklist for compensating participants

Follow these steps when you are ready to begin the compensation process.

1. Complete the
   [TTS User Research Participant Compensation Justification Checklist](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15SxB0JCi-OvTD2lLokkuixb9sWuu1i2v-K8wGhPqcno/edit).
   Save it in your project folder, and save a copy in the
   [user research compensation justifications folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0AGmTTInlTCCQUk9PVA).
2. If working with a partner agency, confirm the IAA includes
   [Attachment B - User Research Compensation Authorization](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ehb3W14_eEo8DdHjU0bCeyzG_t8I__7VyLV_cU4ZmQY).

For gift card purchases, see
[instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QBBwldQDgqxCgDeHMivHhDjOyo2oBfGn8_DaXe9HnXk/edit?usp=sharing)
($10,000 or less)

## Managing Personally Identifiable Information (PII)

We work in the open, but we need to be mindful of discussing agency partners,
collecting any PII, or accidentally disclosing PII.

### What is PII?

PII is information that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual's
identity, either alone or when combined with other information. Because there
are many different types of information that can be used to distinguish or trace
an individual's identity, the term PII is necessarily broad. The definition of
PII is not anchored to any single category of information or technology. Rather,
it requires a case-by-case assessment of the specific risk that an individual
can be identified using information that is linked or linkable to said
individual. For that reason, Social Security Numbers, Alien Registration
Numbers, and driver's license numbers are always PII. Email addresses, phone
numbers, and mailing addresses are sometimes PII, and when presented in
combination with a first name, often become PII. Photos of people's faces are
almost always PII, and that's why we always ask before taking photos and get
explicit statements about if we can share them.

[Sensitive PII]({% page "/launching-software/privacy/" %}) is information which,
if shared, could seriously harm or embarrass someone. Unique identifying numbers
and biometric data is always sensitive: In general, combining:

- Citizenship or immigration status
- Ethnic or religious affiliation
- Medical information
- Sexual orientation
- Criminal history

with PII always makes that PII sensitive. However, determining what is and isn't
PII, and what is or isn't sensitive PII can often require some reflection.

Much of our research involves federal employees. When we are talking to federal
employees (not contractors, and not vendors) about their work, they generally
have no reasonable expectation of privacy. After all, the material may have to
be disclosed pursuant to a judge's order, a Congressional request, or a FOIA
request.

As researchers, however, we need to follow the principle of beneficence. So just
following the legal guidelines on PII isn't enough if you're collecting
information that you know might harm or embarrass your participants if it became
generally known, _whether or not those participants are federal employees_.
Different agencies and organizations may have different levels of sensitivity
and exposure concerns about types of personal information (identifying or not)
you collect and how you use it. Attributing quotations with agency affiliation,
for example, may be more sensitive than first name and photo. In those cases,
the principle of beneficence demands that we think carefully about protecting
participants before sharing working notes or finished reports, even if we have
satisfied the law.

### Storing PII and sharing research data

If you are collecting PII in the course of research, the best place to store it
is in a locked-down folder on Google Drive that is only accessible to the core
research team, as Google Drive is is a GSA-approved place to store PII. (The
only other GSA-approved software for storing PII is Salesforce, which we don't
use for research). Raw interview notes, which may contain PII, should be stored
in this folder. The core research team should also create a document that gives
each participant a pseudonym (eg. a codename or number such as "PO1"). Analysis
& synthesis documents and research reports, which are typically accessed by
additional members of the project team, should only contain those pseudonyms or
codes, unless you have obtained explicit permission from a participant to use,
for example, their likeness in a photo or video clip. If you have any paper
documents with PII, they always go into a locked file cabinet.

A good rule is to check with your project lead before sharing information
outside the immediate team. What has been approved by GSA may not be approved by
partners. Check the Appendix in [Design page]({% page "/design/" %}) for
detailed information about who can see what, when. The social media,
collaboration, and security classes in GSA's Online University can also be
helpful in managing access.

Be especially mindful about using Slack during interviews for sidebar
conversations. No PII should go into Slack channels unless your participant has
explicitly consented to have PII shared with the general public. And even then,
be aware of the potential level of visibility any information will have once you
post it in Slack.

Carefully restricting access to personally identifiable information is a matter
not just of people's right to respect but of their right to
[privacy](https://methods.18f.gov/privacy/). For more information, please see
the
[Design research privacy impact assessment (PIA)](https://www.gsa.gov/cdnstatic/20200401_-_Design_Research_PIA_for%20posting.pdf),
or

narrated by the GSA Privacy Office.

**Bottom line: If you have questions about sharing information, just ask.** See
the page on [sensitive information]({% page "/sensitive-information/" %}). If
you're not sure if you're collecting PII or need help with policy guidance, you
can ask on Slack in {% slack_channel "#g-research" %}. If you are not sure where
the right place might be to store any given file, or what access permissions to
grant, you can [ask the Tech
Portfolio]({% page "/office-of-solutions/tech-portfolio/#questions" %}).
