Projects at 18F begin as opportunities. An opportunity can arrive in a variety
of ways. For example, a potential partner agency can contact us directly to ask
about working together, the director of business development or a portfolio
director may reach out to an agency to follow-up on a recent news story that
indicates a need we may be able to help with, or a previous partner agency that
was happy with our work together spreads the word to their contacts in other
agencies.

However it happens, when a new opportunity comes in, the
[business development]({{site.base_url}}/18f-bd/) process kicks off. To help
keep track of it, it is added to the
[BD Opportunities tab in the 18F Dashboard🔒](https://airtable.com/tblXEgAIZzipuVNZY/viwoNkShDjSTt2Adu?blocks=hide).
The new opportunity will begin with a stage of **Identified**.

Depending on the category of the opportunity, the director of business
development, a portfolio director, or a domain champion will then take over as
the BD lead to shepherd it through the process. They will look into the lead,
doing some background research to understand the need and talk to project leads,
account managers, and other folks who have any history with the partner or have
knowledge or experience with the project or space. Once they feel like they have
a good initial idea of the need, the Dashboard is updated and the opportunity is
moved into the **Prioritized** stage.

The BD lead will schedule a meeting with the potential partner agency, the
business development reps from the chapters, an account manager, and appropriate
portfolio directors. This meeting is about making sure 18F understands the
agency's needs, that our offerings fit their needs, that we have the right
expertise to help them in the right timeframe, and that the project fits with
what we value. After this meeting, if everyone on the 18F team agrees that we
should move forward, the Dashboard is updated again to move the opportunity into
the **Qualified** stage, meaning that we believe it's a project that we should
try to take on.

Once an opportunity is qualified, the account manager writes up a short proposal
to get aligned on the partner need, desired outcomes, and general shape of the
work. This proposal can include input from the BD lead and/or portfolio
directors. They then send it off for the partner agency to review. There can be
some back-and-forth ironing out all the details, but once both sides agree on
the proposal, the dashboard is updated. The opportunity gets moved into the
**Scoped** stage. Additionally, a
[Project🔒](https://airtable.com/tblRHYBJtIZOxImMd/viw48sDuxG6HSKOhN?blocks=hide)
is created in the Dashboard, also staged to **Scoped**. This reflects our
optimism that the opportunity is going to turn into a real project that will
need to be staffed.

In addition to updating the Dashboard, the account manager may also create a
preliminary [staffing issue](https://github.com/18F/staffing/issues) at this
point. It will be tagged with **Needs IAA** so staffing leads know it can't be
staffed yet, but it can give them a heads-up that a need may be coming and help
them with other staffing decisions.

The next step in the process is for 18F and the partner agency to sign an
[interagency agreement (IAA)]({{site.base_url}}/agreements/). The IAA process
can take a little time as it bounces back and forth between all the appropriate
signatories on both sides, but once it's signed on both sides, both the
opportunity and the project in the Dashboard are moved into the **Executed**
stage. At this point, the opportunity has reached the end of its lifecycle and
business development hands everything over to staffing to get the project
started. If there is already a staffing issue, the **Needs IAA** label is
replaced with the **Staffing Request** tag; otherwise, a new staffing issue is
created and tagged with **Staffing Request**.

The chapter staffing leads now look at the staffing issue to understand the more
specific project needs and scope. They then consider the particular skills and
availability of the people in their chapters to decide who will be able to work
on the project and when it can start. Collectively, they staff the project and
set a tentative start date.

Once the project team is all together and ready to start, the project is updated
in the Dashboard to the **Launched** stage.

There are two other project stages: **Paused** and **Landed**. A paused project
is one that was launched but we've had to stop work on, often temporarily.
Projects can be paused for things like a lapse in funding, an IAA expiring
before a new one could be signed, or a mismatch in project team skills or
working styles that needs to be restaffed. Paused projects usually go back to
the **Launched** stage, though sometimes they are ended completely. Projects
that are finished, for whatever reason, are moved into the **Landed** stage.
