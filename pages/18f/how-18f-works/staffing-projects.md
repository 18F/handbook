18F partner projects and 10x projects are staffed using a process outlined in
the [staffing repo](https://github.com/18F/staffing). The staffing repo README
details specific processes for staffing new projects, changing staffing on
in-flight projects, and making "microrequests" (requests that are for fewer than
eight total hours of work per week overall).
