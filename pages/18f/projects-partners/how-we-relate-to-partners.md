18F's fundamental goal isn’t to implement agile, replace legacy systems, or
change procurement. Our real goal is to **help each partner fulfill the mission
of their agency and serve the public**.

## Why partnership?

Technology is a necessary part of how government works (and has been, from quill
and paper to the telegraph and the internet), but even maintaining technology is
now a complex full-time job. Adopting the latest methods or experimenting with
new tools is often impossible for partners who need to prioritize delivering a
baseline service.

That's where we can help: our partners call on us to bring technical expertise,
new methods, and a fresh perspective to ensure that technology serves their
objectives while remaining **human-centered, resilient to change, and worthy of
the public’s trust**.

## Principles for consulting work

Our ability to create change in the federal government relies on building
strong, trusting relationships with our partners. Pragmatically speaking, 18F’s
survival also depends on building a reputation for being great to work with.

We build trust when we’re able to demonstrate the value of our deep technology
expertise by showing, with clarity and conviction, how new approaches can help
our partners. In addition, we keep these principles in mind as we engage with
partners:

- **Empathy:** Changing how government approaches technology is hard, slow, and
  incremental work — both for us and for our partners. Our work is more
  effective when we bring compassion and patience to the constraints of our
  partners and appreciate the risks they face in spearheading change.
- **Curiosity:** The more we can ground our work in genuine curiosity about
  their mission and the details of delivering on that mission, the more our
  recommendations will be concrete, transformative, and possible.
- **Humility:** We are not experts in other agencies’ work. If we can gain their
  trust, our partners are our best guides to their organization, users,
  processes, and opportunities, and we learn as much from them as they learn
  from us.
- **Transparency:** Our work is best when we bring partners along through
  everything we do. Showing them the process helps us model the work and build a
  foundation for them to take it over.

### We work _with_, not _for_, our partners

We want to help them work in new ways and succeed beyond our time together. In
choosing work and designing engagements, we aim to build partners’ capacity for
managing effective technology products that support their strategic needs and
serve their users.
