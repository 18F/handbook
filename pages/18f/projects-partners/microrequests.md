## What is a microrequest?

A microrequest is a piece of carefully scoped work that can be completed quickly
and without impacting the ability to complete other assigned work. This
typically translates to fewer than four hours of work in a week, and requests
that should take no more than three weeks. Requests which require more resources
than this will be handled on a case-by-case basis and may be handed off to the
18F staffing team.

## Is your request billable?

If so, direct your request to #microrequests channel. If your tasks is
non-billable, post it in `#helpwanted`. If you are unsure, post in #microrequests
and a channel manager will let you know.

## What capabilities can be extended through the microrequest process?

- Writing and content strategy tasks including generative (coming up with
  ideas), developmental (structuring your thoughts), stylistic (checking the
  consistency of your voice and striking the right tone), or copy editing
  (checking for clarity and typos).
- Engineering tasks including development, code/architecture reviews, security
  fixes, training, pairing, and more
- Design tasks such as scoping, ideating, structuring, creating, styling, and/or
  refining design deliverables.
- Something else or not sure? Ask in #microrequests and we’ll do our best to
  find help or direct you to the right place.

## What is the process for making a microrequest?

Describe your need in the #microrequests channel, where one of our channel
managers will help to scope it and will then submit a
[staffing request](https://github.com/18F/staffing/issues). Please do not
request specific people when making your requests. The staffing leads will work
to identify the right people to help you.

The microrequest channel managers will make the determination about whether the
description of the work matches the definition of a microrequest above. If the
work is beyond the scope of a microrequest, we will make our best effort to
complete the work, but will not put existing project work at risk. Typically,
requests larger than 4 hours a week will be put through 18F's standard staffing
process.

Requests for billable projects (including requests from other TTS offices) may
be prioritized over non-billable work. Otherwise, microrequests will be handled
on a first-come, first-served basis and according to the available resources.
For example, if two requests for visual design support are made, the work will
be completed in the order the request was made.

## Will microrequests always be fulfilled?

Not necessarily. We’ll try to fulfill requests as soon as we reasonably can. If
your microrequest has a tight timeline, we may not be able to find someone who
is available right away. To the best of our ability, we’ll provide estimates of
when and if we’re able to fulfill your request.

## How is work on microrequests Tocked?

If there is a project associated with the microrequest, the person completing
the work will Tock to that project line. The person submitting the request
should provide the Tock line to use.

18F has individual agreements with TTS Solutions, Login, PIF, TTS Front Office
and CoE. The necessary tock line and approver (if applicable) is documented in
the #microrequests channel topic . The agreements covers the costs associated
with the 18F labor, but the requests must still adhere to the definitions above.
That is, microrequests will be fulfilled when they don’t impact 18F’s ability to
deliver on other partner projects to which people are staffed.

If you’re working on a microrequest, remember that microrequests that are
related to billable projects or that fall within the TTS sibling org agreement
contribute to your overall billable hours expectations. This work should
contribute to your overall billable target for the week.

If your office does not have a signed MOU with 18F, work cannot be completed by
18F staff. These requests will be routed through 18F's Business Development
process.
