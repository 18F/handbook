Making procurement joyful

## Welcome!

Welcome to the 18F Acquisition Chapter — we’re happy you’re here! We’ve compiled
some information to help you get started. We’ll update this guide as we receive
feedback, so don’t be shy to share your thoughts.

### Who we are

Members of the Acquisition team come from all over: inside GSA, consulting
firms, Peace Corps, and other government agencies. Collectively, we work as the
acquisition part of the overall 18F cross-functional team bringing our expertise
to help agency partners (experts in their mission) produce more effective
procurement strategies, implement modern procurement practices, and better
vendor outcomes. We’re experienced in a wide variety of procurements and have
tons of stories of procurements that have gone well and some that haven’t. Ask
us!

### Our vision and mission

The Acquisition Chapter exists to prove that government acquisitions can be
joyful for our employees, agency partners, and industry partners. We do this, by
ensuring that informed buyers can easily and confidently access the right
products and services to meet their agency’s mission. No matter what the agency
partner is undertaking or trying to solve, the acquisition process will be
unavoidable and it can be used as an amazing point for leverage to improve
overall outcomes.

As a team, we are dedicated to bringing an agile, human centered, and
cross-functional approach to procurements that will better prepare our partners
to work with modern vendor teams iteratively; developing open source software
products to help agencies achieve their mission.

### Our value proposition

18F Acquisition Consulting helps agencies buy digital services in a way that
reduces risk and provides value to end-users more rapidly than traditional
methods. We seek to design and evangelize acquisition approaches that are better
aligned with current industry practices to ensure the successful delivery of
digital products and services that truly meet the needs of our agency partners
and the people they serve.

### Our principles

- Use **human-centered design** to focus on software that meets actual people's
  needs/
- Leverage **open-source software**, and select modern tech stacks to ensure
  long-term sustainability.
- Utilize **product thinking** to prioritize, focus work, and deliver
  demonstrable value.
- Structure contracts to **support modularity, lower costs, increase quality,
  and avoid vendor lock-in.**
- Ensure that **agile development methodologies** are employed to deliver
  working code sooner.
- **Communicate clearly** about methods, lessons learned, and recommendations.

### What we do

We focus on procurements of intentionally modest scope for digital products and
services (procures and deliver incrementally), so that we can deliver end-user
value more rapidly, assess the results more quickly, and refine our approaches
over time.

In pursuit of this strategy, we:

- Consult with our agency partners to help them buy digital products and
  services demonstrating that compliance can still be achieved in the context of
  more efficient and effective acquisition approaches.
- Develop innovative acquisition strategies within the confines of the Federal
  Acquisition Regulation (FAR).
- Develop and pilot novel methods of working with industry and encourage vendors
  of all sizes to compete for work and offer their unique skills to government.
- Work in the open. We strive to publicly share as much information about our
  work with agencies partners as possible. Vendors we partner with commit to
  using open-source technologies.
- Consult with partner agencies on acquisition strategy, conduct workshops,
  provide pre-award and post-award coaching. Our work is rooted in real project
  work to assist our partner agencies to develop the skills needed to be more
  savvy consumers of digital products and services moving forward, and ensure
  their long-term success beyond the scope of our work together.

### How we communicate

The majority of our conversations take place on Slack and video. There are a
number of Slack channels for acquisition discussions.

### Pro-tips for working with our partners

_(these are from your Acq Chapter friends)_

#### Teach partners how to fish

- **Success is working ourselves out of a job.** We strive to increase our
  partners’ knowledge and capacity until we can transfer the entire project back
  to them; comfortable that they have the tools and resources to continue
  seamlessly.
- **Encourage and foster failure, fast.** One of the underlying tenets of our
  principles and methods is that you cannot avoid failure. Instead the goal is
  to reduce the impact of such failures as much as possible to create a feedback
  loop for learning that only grows exponentially. For example, with typical
  contracting cycles of 2-3 years for a “major” contract it means that you will
  only have 10-12 examples in a typical federal employee’s career. Contrast this
  with ours whereby the procurement process occurs every 1-3 months and you now
  have generated far greater experience in a much briefer period of time. We’re
  literally hacking time here.

- **Start small and build.** It can be overwhelming starting a new project with
  an excited partner. Encourage them to focus on one piece of functionality to
  deliver to users. This is your starting point. Trying to deliver an entire
  end-to-end system is likely to stall the project due to lack of focus. You
  will also encounter the same principles and practices on a small project that
  would be applied to a far larger one. Don’t try to win a marathon before
  you’ve learned to run in the first place.

- **Retros are your friend.** Recognize that there isn’t a one-size-fits-all
  approach to procurement or product development and it’s necessary to meet the
  agency partner where they are. Allow for incremental learning over time.
  Ensure that these are blameless spaces, because without transparent and honest
  communication the dynamics will slowly fester and create the kinds of legacy
  environments that can stymie progress at the partner agencies.

#### Situational awareness

- **Build your empathy muscle.** Take time to understand the problem space, past
  challenges, and the goals of the product team.

- **Product owners are key to success.** Be wary of starting post-procurement
  work with an agency partner if there is no empowered, dedicated product owner
  to lead the work.

- **Engage with security early and often.** We’ve learned that security is one
  of the sticking points for delivering government products. If you are not an
  expert in security, bring somebody who is.

- **Post it everywhere.** We post on e-buy, FBO.gov, and GitHub.

#### Work with (not for) the vendors

- **Our highest duty is to our agency partners.** (Not the partners’ vendor) We
  work closely with the vendor intent on developing good working relationships,
  AND we always prioritize our client’s best interests above all else.
- **Vendor lock-in is bad for everyone.** We encourage our agency partners to
  prioritize internalizing expertise and using vendors as interchangeable
  complements to their own team. That includes 18F, which is also a vendor.
- **Talk to industry!** We are comfortable having conversations with industry as
  the FAR advises us to do.
  - Do we sign **vendor non-disclosure agreements** (NDAs)? Generally, no. As
    government employees, we aren’t allowed to sign other companies' NDAs in our
    professional capacity without going through the Office of General Counsel
    (OGC). However, federal employees are already required to protect vendor
    information under
    [18 USC §1905](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1905).

#### 18F is here for you

- **Ask for help.** Know there is a powerful ecosystem of 18Fers who are on-call
  to help with any areas where you need more assistance, whether it’s design,
  security practices, or product management best practices. We see new things
  every day, but it’s unlikely that someone hasn’t seen something like what
  you’re experiencing before and can offer a hand, ear, or whatever other body
  part you may need given the circumstances.

- **Not everyone is ready for the 18F way on day one.** Our principles mirror
  agile software development and we are committed to modern procurement
  practices (ie. modular contracting). It’s ok to recognize that implementing
  new practices can be difficult and challenging. What’s worse would be to force
  it onto someone not ready and see them stumble in
  [very predictable ways](https://18f.gsa.gov/2018/09/27/antipatterns-in-agile-contracting/).
