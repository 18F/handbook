# Joining the Design Team

Welcome to the 18F Design team — we’re happy you’re here! We’ve compiled a set
of helpful tips to get you started. We’ll update this guide as we receive
feedback, so don’t be shy to share your thoughts.

## First week

You might not have much assigned work during your first two weeks here. That’s
okay and expected. If you’ve gotten all the government onboarding items done and
a project *still* hasn’t landed, the design team has a list of internal projects
that aren’t funded but that will help us all work better together. Talk to your
supervisor (more on that, below) to get more information about these internal
projects and how you can get involved.

## Who we are

The Design team at 18F includes content, user experience, front-end, product,
and service designers. We are researchers, editors, prototypers, illustrators,
and wordsmiths. We come from a variety of backgrounds, including government,
non-profits, consultancies, corporations, and academia.

### Structure

As per the
[org chart](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/189TanLPSFF9MWvNr6VdfUvhBAWBSXeoCSGD2ZXRDm3s/edit?usp=sharing),
18F Design is itself composed of product design, content strategy, change
strategy, and user experience teams. Members of the Design team are active
participants in the content and research
\[guilds]({% page "/working-groups-and-guilds-101" %}).

Before starting at 18F, you will have been assigned a supervisor. Supervisors meet with you regularly and carry out most managerial responsibilities for their disciplines. They lead staffing, hiring, training, and project troubleshooting for their discipline. More detail on [Design team roles and responsibilities](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XqgwiUItzRZu4I8KcpQlkCCd5iXM_EbTwsUzXwy-L-w/edit#heading=h.bc6vwqoy0xk4)is provided internally.

Members of the Design team are also assigned to **critique groups.** These
groups meet regularly (barring more urgent project activities) to discuss work
in progress and help the Design team maintain its storytelling and presentation
skills. Critique groups also have leaders, and their groupings change
periodically. These rotations are announced ahead of time. If you're interested
in taking a turn as a critique lead, you can raise your hand as a candidate at
that time.

## What we do

The Design team at 18F provides design services in our projects and to the
organization, including:

* **Research.** We test assumptions by gathering feedback from real users,
  stakeholders, subject-matter experts, etc.
* **Content strategy.** We help people clarify their tone and voice, and explore
  the breadth and depth of their content.
* **Information architecture.** We help people state their intent and disclose
  information in an intuitive way.
* **Interaction design.** We work with people to wireframe and prototype simple,
  beautiful, usable interactions.
* **Product design.** We help people communicate clearly through visualizations
  and illustrations.
* **Service design.** We work with partners to map their customers' experiences
  and business processes in order to design interactions across systems and over
  time.

## How we work

### Rituals

Most of the design team works on a mix of partner-agency projects and internal
initiatives. As you’d guess, everyone’s weeks look a little different. That
said, there are recurring weekly meetings and commitments we all have on our
calendars.

* **Wednesdays:** every other week for 45 minutes at 2:30pm ET (11:30am PT)
  design team huddle. The whole team meets to discuss project status, policy
  updates, and general design-specific news. Our huddles typically follow the
  same format: the Design Director provides general announcements. The rest of
  the huddle features a presentation or conversation about a topic of current
  interest to the team. Past topics have included: how other chapters work, our
  collaborative work practices, and recent organizational changes within 18F or
  TTS.
* **Once a week/Every two weeks:** Meet with your supervisor. You’ll have a short check-in with your supervisor at a time that’s convenient for both of you. 
  The purpose of this meeting is both administrative and personal. It’s how the
  team leadership keeps on top of project timelines and activities to coordinate
  resourcing. It’s also a time to talk through any project concerns, figure out
  how to wrangle the federal bureaucracy, and talk about how to make 18F work
  better for you.
* **Once a week:** meet with your critique group. Crit groups discuss creative
  questions and share work. We re-form the groups periodically so we have
  opportunities to learn from the whole group.

### Tools

Here are some common tools we use, how we use them, and how you can get access
to them. If you can’t find the information you need in the chart below, get in
touch with your supervisor; they’ll be able to point you in the right
direction

And one more thing: before you start using any new tool that asks for access to
files/browser data, see the [Software]({{base.baseurl}}/software/) page and
assure the tool is approved.

#### Drawing lines on a screen

Unless otherwise specified, **see
\[Software]({% page "/general-information-and-resources/software/#software-already-approved-in-gear" %})
to get a license** for any of these.

* **Figma** Talk with your supervisor to request a license
* [**Sketch**]({% page "/sketch/" %})
* [**InVision**]({% page "/invision/" %})
* **OmniGraffle:**
  [Request a license](https://gsa.servicenowservices.com/sp/?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=1bfdfdca78d3a400ce3ddff91a64940b)
* [**Adobe Creative Cloud**]({% page "/adobe/" %})
* **[Microsoft Visio](https://products.office.com/en-us/visio/flowchart-software)** -
  Visio isn't available for Mac, but you can \[request it get added to your
  Citrix VDI instance]({% page "/tools/virtual-desktop/#software" %}).

#### Project management

Every project and team has a different mix of project management tools based on
what works for them. Many internal projects will use **Trello** because it's
fast to set up. Get more information on the \[How to use
Trello]({% page "/trello" %}) page.

#### Research

* Please read \[Doing Research at 18F]({% page "/research-guidelines" %}) for
  more information on the tools and techniques.
* **Analytics:** We recommend leveraging the
  [Digital Analytics Program](https://digital.gov/services/dap/) whenever
  possible. We augment DAP with site-specific Google analytics tracking. Ask
  your lead or post in {% slack_channel "analytics" %} to ask to chat with
  someone to learn more.
* **Surveys:** Internal to 18F, we often use Google Forms. However, government
  employees outside 18F often can't access Google Forms on their work computers.
  So when addressing our agency partners, we often need to use other options,
  such as [Touchpoints](https://touchpoints.digital.gov/) — being careful, of
  course, to avoid asking for personally identifiable information (PII) and meet
  requirements of the [Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA)](https://pra.digital.gov/).
  Ask {% slack_channel "g-research" "the research guild" %} for recommendations.

#### Workshops / virtual workspaces

* **Mural:** Research analysis and workshops. Check out the \[Handbook Mural
  page]({% page "/tools/mural/" %}) for more information. Access is immediate.

#### Word processing

* **Google Drive / Docs / Slides:** This is our primary tool for documents of
  various sorts.
* [**Microsoft Office**]({% page "/office/" %})

### Assets

We default to free and open-source assets, unless there is a very good reason to
do otherwise. (You would need to document the reason and get approval).
Fortunately, there are many great resources for us to choose from.

* **18F-themed templates:** Access document and slide templates through
  [18F's Visual Identity Guide](https://brand.18f.gov/templates). Unless your
  project has its own branded communication materials, like login.gov or
  cloud.gov, use these styles and templates for communicating about all of your
  work at 18F. It's often beneficial for partners when we present deliverables
  with our brand styling, which shows the outside expertise they brought in. It
  also helps 18F present itself with a unified voice, tone, and look.
* **Frameworks:** the
  [U.S. Web Design System](https://designsystem.digital.gov/) is a visual style
  guide and set of components for U.S. federal government websites. It includes
  guidance for fonts, colors, and UI components. Come chat in
  {% slack_channel "dev-frontend" %} if you are choosing a framework for
  something.
* **Icons:**

  * The product design team maintains guidance on
    [icon resources](https://github.com/18F/visual-design/wiki/Icon-sets).
  * If you want to start using non-free ones, you’ll need to jump through some
    hoops — even if the icon only costs $1.99. You’ll need to get official
    emailed permission from the product owner, then check
    {% slack_channel "teamops" %} for further instructions.
* **Images:** Most images published by government agencies are in the public
  domain and thus free to use.

  * The product design team maintains guidance on
    [government photography resources](https://github.com/18F/visual-design/wiki/Government-photography).
  * You can use `incategory:PD_US_Government` as part of a search query on
    Wikimedia Commons:
    [example](https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Search&profile=default&fulltext=Search&search=incategory%3APD_US_Government+example&uselang=en&searchToken=5902rmnmjz5fivko9172xs74c).
  * While you’re at it, visit the
    [Department of the Interior’s Instagram](https://instagram.com/usinterior/)
    stream. You’ll be glad you did.
* **Typography:** Partner agencies often have their own style guidance that we
  follow in our work with them. 18F-branded materials should follow typography
  guidance in the [18F Visual Identity Guide](https://brand.18f.gov/). For needs
  outside these scenarios, typefaces from the
  [U.S. Web Design System](https://designsystem.digital.gov/) are a safe
  starting choice. Come chat in {% slack_channel "product-design" %} if you are
  choosing fonts for something.

# Appendix

## Designing in the open

We do most of our design work in the open, which means trying to make as much
documentation and decision-making as possible accessible to the public.
Designing in the open means that expectations from private sector about
confidentiality, disclosure, and intellectual property don’t hold true here.

Here are some of our rules of thumb:

### 1. Share your work early and often

Sharing your in-progress work with team members and stakeholders is one of the
most powerful techniques we have — it’s central to building trust with
stakeholders. At 18F, we like to team up and work a problem through multiple
angles to get to the best solution swiftly.

Since GitHub is a tool we’ve chosen for facilitating public dialogue, consider
also making your work available to the public (if appropriate for the project)
by posting work-in-progress there. Before creating a public GitHub repo or
otherwise sharing project-specific information, check with your project lead;
they’ll let you know what information can be shared publicly.

### 2. Be mindful of Personally Identifiable Information (PII)

PII is any piece of data, singly or in combination, that can identify unique
individuals, such as full name, email address, or even phone number. While
working in the open, be mindful of discussing agency partners, collecting any
PII, or accidentally disclosing PII to the entire internet. Different agencies
and organizations may have different levels of sensitivity and exposure concerns
about types of personal information (identifying or not) you collect and how you
use it. Check with your project lead before sharing information to avoid
missteps and delays; what has been approved by the GSA may not already have been
approved by partners. Be mindful as you post meeting notes or sidebar
conversations in Slack channels, and be aware of the potential level of
visibility this information will have once you post it in Slack.

Bottom line: If you have questions about sharing information, ask.

### 3. Not everything has to happen in public

The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) guarantees that, as federal employees, all
of our communication via government email, Slack, and chat can be made available
to the public at some point in the future. You should assume that, at some point
in the future, anyone might be reading what you wrote in any of these channels.
Meanwhile, in the context of day-to-day work, different tools offer different
levels of access. Here’s a quick reference to who can see what, when:

* Only viewable by addresses: Slack DMs, Slack private groups, Email
* 18F only: open Slack channels
* 18F plus invited guests: Slack channels labelled XXX-otheragencyhere or
  XXX-partners
* GSA only: Google Drive- you can share files outside GSA, but exercise caution!
* Across the government: mailing lists
* The entire Internet: Slack channels labelled -public, Invision and Mural (if
  linked via GitHub), and GitHub (with the exception of private repos)
