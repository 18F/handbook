Account Managers (AMs) at 18F are the connective tissue across 18F projects that
allow us to build long-term relationships with partners and consistently help
18F project teams deliver value.

Because of the number of projects they're involved with, AMs serve as hubs of
institutional knowledge for project teams.

## Different roles at different times

The role of the account manager changes over the course of each project. For
example, account managers are critical in the initial business development
process (before an agreement even exists), then as a strategic advisor and
resource while projects are underway.

### Pre-agreement

Account managers help vet the work and begin establishing a relationship with
the potential partner, allowing for a single point of contact throughout the
agreements process and beyond.

In consultation with the scoping team, the AM takes over the partner
relationship and begins preparing the agreement. This means **lots** of
conversations with the partner, in which the AM works to set the partner’s
expectations and understand as much as possible about their organization before
an 18F team begins work.

During discussion(s) with the partner, the AM will:

- Revisit the work initially discussed and gather additional detail
- Introduce the partner to the TTS agreements process, including timeline
  expectations, forms, signatures, and funding constraints
- Request background materials (including prior research, repos, org charts, or
  lists of stakeholders)
- Provide information about pre-agreement work (such as identifying users for
  research)
- Identify potential barriers to accessing partner systems and using
  collaborative tools
- Gather and synthesize information about measures that matter so the 18F team
  has more context about the partner environment (including the partner's
  relationship with IT/security, procurement shop, any current vendors, our
  ability to access systems/data, and relevant oversight/governance bodies)
- Align on expectations for working with 18F (including reviewing roles,
  responsibilities, time expectations, and how we're different from other
  vendors).

The AM then works with the partner to draft the statement of work (SOW). Once
there’s agreement on the SOW, the Account Manager should ask the partner to
complete the [prep survey](https://airtable.com/shrzQith6pnfzdBUv) to the TTS
agreements team so they can prepare the IAA package and route it to the partner
for signature. The AM must also share the SOW and cost estimator with the
Agreement’s Team. Once an agreement has been submitted to the IAA process, the
AM continues working with the scoping team to identify project staffing needs
and submit a staffing issue to the
[Staffing Repo](https://github.com/18F/staffing). Projects are not staffed until
the agreement has been _fully executed_ and it can take _up to 8 weeks_ to staff
a project after it’s been executed.

### Project kickoff

Once the agreement is executed and staffed, a Tock line is created (by the
account manager reaching out to the tock team) and billable work can begin. The
AM schedules and prepares an
[internal kickoff](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DtM5FqxGdP54Mt5aWD6VqzgRLfgOBvZo8vtpuLuaFz4/edit)
with the entire 18F project team, and introduces the partner to the [18F project
lead]({% page "/18f/projects-partners/leading-projects/" %}). This marks the
beginning of billable work on the project, and signals the moment that primary
ownership of the project work is handed off to the staffed team.

### In-flight projects

Once projects are underway, account managers are advocates for the project,
team, and partner. AMs are members of project teams, and attend project meetings
(when possible) to provide input, address any red flags, and gain visibility
into the project work. Because they have the longer-term context of the partner
relationship _and_ a high-level view across 18F projects, account managers can
help support the partner and the team in service of the project goals. Their
exposure to various projects across 18F (and TTS) past and present also gives
them a unique perspective to resolving blockers. Account managers remain in
contact with partner agencies throughout the engagement’s duration to monitor
expectations, provide customer service, and gather feedback.

As part of a project team, the account manager is responsible for:

**Finances**

- Tracking the project’s budget and burn, and identifying patterns, risks, and
  opportunities
- Updating the project’s financial status in the Weekly Ship
- Modifying agreements when necessary
- Developing travel estimates and obtaining approvals

**Collaboration**

- Getting partners set up in Slack and other tools
- Making sure the 18F team has the tools, resources, and skills to deliver on
  the scope of work

**Maintaining partner relationships**

- Managing partner expectations and supporting the project lead in maintaining
  alignment between the project team and partner about goals and deliverables
- Identifying further work, including proposing, estimating, and scoping, then
  shepherding partners through the agreements process

**Promoting quality**

- Working with the Chief of Projects to ensure value is being delivered to the
  partner and that project artifacts are in line with 18F standards
- Provide project health updates to 18F leadership, as well as sharing lessons
  and successes
- Tracking the overall project timeline and ensuring key milestones are being
  met

**Troubleshooting challenges and escalation**

- Resolving internal 18F team conflicts, in partnership with the project lead
- Resolving and escalating partner issues with the project lead
- Serving as meeting facilitator (or helping to identify an outside facilitator)
  for retrospectives or difficult conversations, if needed

## How should you work with your Account Manager?

Most Account Managers are responsible for a number of projects in various
stages—some in business development, some in the IAA process, some in-flight—so
while they won’t be able to attend all project meetings, they’ll be in touch
with project leads on a weekly basis, as well as in regular contact with your
agency partner POC to see how the project is going from their perspective. Your
AM will also check in occasionally with all project team members to ensure they
understand the project from all perspectives.

The account manager is a member of your project team, so in general, invite them
to all recurring project meetings (both internal and with the partner),
including sprint planning, standups, demos, retros, and presentations. They can
serve as a powerful resource, and visibility into the work helps them advocate
for your project needs.

If you’re worried about your project, bring up any concerns or blockers with
your AM. From questions about how to deliver value, scope creep, or workloads to
concerns about the partner relationship or team dynamics, the AM has seen it
before! For issues that are bigger than the team, AMs will help the project team
determine whether and when to escalate by looping in other folks, such as the
Chief of Projects, Portfolio Director, or Chief of Staff.
