18F Engineering is responsible for delivering high quality, robust, open source
software. We also evangelize best practices relating to software testing,
scalability, operations, security, and agile development.

Collectively, we’re experienced in a wide variety of technologies including
Python, Ruby, server and client-side JavaScript, Go, C, relational and
schema-less databases, ETL pipelines, version control, testing frameworks,
machine learning, and more.

## Documentation

Our [Engineering Best Practices guide](https://engineering.18f.gov)
([git repo](https://github.com/18F/development-guide#18f-development-guide)) has
details about our approach, tools, languages, and more. You might also enjoy the
[open source](https://18f.gsa.gov/tags/open-source/) archives on the blog.

# Joining the Engineering team

Welcome to the 18F Engineering team — we’re happy you’re here! We’ve compiled
tips to help you get started. We’ll update this guide as we receive feedback, so
don’t be shy to share your thoughts.

## First week

You might not have much assigned work during your first few weeks here. That’s
okay and expected. If you’ve gotten all the government onboarding items done and
a project _still_ hasn’t landed, the Engineering team has a long list of
internal projects that aren’t funded but that will help us work better together.
Talk to your supervisor to learn more.

## Who we are

Members of the Engineering team come from all over: major technology companies,
startups, civic nonprofits, other parts of government, and news outlets.
Collectively, we’re experienced in a wide variety of technologies. You'll
probably be able to find someone to help you with whatever question you have.

### Structure

As per [the org chart]({% page "/org-chart" %}), 18F Engineering is itself
composed of smaller, “engineering teams” which we call cohorts. A cohort shares
a supervisor and serves as small communities of practice to encourage
cross-pollination that might not otherwise occur in a large, distributed team.

Cohorts occasionally meet to:

- Workshop tech talks (in preparation for a wider team talk or speaking
  engagement)
- Demo projects
- Collaboratively solve architecture/programming problems
- Improve 18F’s hiring (group resume review, interview practice)
- Engage in discussions and feedback sessions
- Introduce members to one another!

[These activities](https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/1_NKx-zMwYqBqV48k062j4X2zdhKdYUgYlnM3wMpn5p8/edit)
are largely meant to increase cohesion across Engineering.

### Supervisors

The Engineering Supervisors are responsible for the direct supervision of a set
of engineers. Duties include hiring, on-boarding, project staffing, mentoring,
training, supervision, and off-boarding of those engineers. Supervisors conduct
the mid-year and end of year performance evaluations for the engineers reporting
to them. Supervisors do other HR functions such as approving SF-182s, telework
agreements, [HR Links](https://corporateapps.gsa.gov/hr-links/) requests, and
the like.

Supervisors are the member of the engineering leadership team that individual
contributors form the closest relationship with, and they meet with their
reports for regular 1-on-1s. They also run regular cohort team meetings for
their engineers to build community and support outside the context of project
work. Supervisors act as advocates for their engineers, passing questions and
concerns up the leadership chain as necessar and communicating upcoming changes
to their cohort.

Supervisors are selected through nominations and interviews according to team
needs. While there is no additional compensation for being a supervisor, it’s an
opportunity to help make team members’ time at 18F great.

### Director

The Director of Engineering is responsible for the Engineering Chapter. The
Director represents the chapter on the Senior Management Team of 18F, is
responsible for the strategic planning of the chapter including hiring approach,
capacity planning, and expanding the impact of the chapter and engineers’ work.
The Director guides the work of the Engineering Practices guild (which
encompasses backend, frontend, and data) and the diversity, equity, and
inclusion (DE&I) leads to ensure alignment with strategy and each other. The
Director has as direct reports the Engineering Supervisors, and acts as mentor,
coach, and guide to their work. The Director is ultimately responsible for the
success of the chapter in the context of the 18F mission and organizational
priorities.

The Director is selected through nominations and interviews. While there is no
additional compensation for being a director, it’s an opportunity to help make
team members’ time at 18F great.

### DE&I Leads

The DE&I Leads lead efforts to foster a diverse and inclusive environment for
engineers. Their mission includes building a strong culture and setting an
inclusive tone even before a new engineer comes on board. Anyone who has issues
or concerns related to inclusion or equity in the 18F engineering chapter should
feel empowered to reach out to the DE&I Leads. If you have access to the TTS
Slack, you can reach us at @amymok and @alexsoble. You can also reach us by
email at: eng-dei@gsa.gov.

### Leadership

## FAQ

### I’m interested in working on a different or additional project. How can I do that?

Your supervisor and the engineering staffing lead are responsible for making
sure you have the right amount and kind of project work. However, you're
encouraged to get involved in finding projects you're interested in. To do this,
review projects in the
[staffing repository](https://github.com/18F/staffing/issues). The issue threads
will have lots of extraneous information, but look for issues tagged with the
Engineering chapter. If you find a project you're interested in, let the
engineering staffing lead know or talk to your supervisor.

If you're looking for some engineering work to do during your non-billable
hours,
[this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XqhkVs7k7lHqKRwkkJjDMPpB4p18SVn5nQ1xbZ4-knM/edit?usp=sharing)
has some suggestions that might get you started. Always feel free to bring it up
with your supervisor!

### How can I become an interviewer or resume reviewer?

Thanks for wanting to participate in hiring! In order to review resumes, GSA
requires that you be a Subject Matter Expert (SME), which involves a small
amount of training. You don't need to be a SME to be an interviewer.

To do either or both, please get in touch with
{% slack_channel "talent" "the Talent team" %}.

### How can I move from another part of 18F into engineering?

Are you already a member of 18F and interested in moving into the Engineering
Chapter? Hooray! Here are some steps to follow:

1. Talk with a member of the Engineering leadership team (a supervisor or the
   director). Express interest with your supervisor. Let's make sure this move
   is a possibility.
2. Someone from Engineering will review your relevant work – for example any
   software you've written for 18F projects – to understand whether your level
   of software development expertise is appropriate to join Engineering, or
   suggest ways you could develop that expertise.
3. You'll have a meeting with someone from Engineering leadership to review the
   expectations of being in Engineering, review the appropriate performance
   profile, and talk about a development plan to improve software skills, if
   appropriate.
4. Your current supervisor, your new Engineering supervisor, and yourself will
   agree on a transition date.

## Rituals

Most of the Engineering team works on a mix of partner agency projects and
internal initiatives. As you’d guess, everyone’s weeks look a little different.
That said, there are recurring weekly meetings and commitments we all have on
our calendars.

- **Monthly tech talks.** See the 18F Events Calendar or
  [sign up for a talk](https://github.com/18F/tech-talks/blob/master/Queue.md).
- **Once a week (ideally): meet with your supervisor.** Once a week or less
  frequently, depending on your preference, you’ll have a short check-in with
  your supervisor at a time that’s convenient for both of you.
- **Once a week (ideally): meet with your Engineering team.** Once a week,
  you’ll meet with your cohort to conduct
  [various activities](https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/1_NKx-zMwYqBqV48k062j4X2zdhKdYUgYlnM3wMpn5p8/edit)
  designed to bring your team together and share knowledge.

## Mailing lists

- [18F-dev@gsa.gov](https://groups.google.com/a/gsa.gov/forum/#!forum/18fdev).
  All new engineering chapter members should be added by their supervisor. If
  for some reason you didn't get automatically added, give a shout in
  {% slack_channel "dev" %}. Someone there will get you set up.
- [18f-eng-leadership@gsa.gov](https://groups.google.com/a/gsa.gov/forum/#!forum/18f-eng-leadership).
  This is a good way to write to the entire engineering leadership team at once.

## Before you use a new tool...

Here are some [common tools we use]({% page "/#tools" %}), how we use them, and
how you can get access to them. If you can’t find the information you need in
the chart below, get in touch with your design lead; they’ll be able to point
you in the right direction.

And one more thing: before you start using any new tool that asks for access to
files/browser data, see the [Software]({{base.baseurl}}/software/) page and
assure the tool is approved. If what you want to use isn’t there or not
approved, you’ll need to ask {% slack_channel "infrastructure" %} .
