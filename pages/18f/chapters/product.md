We use product management best practices to help teams deliver sustainable
outcomes.

We have a wide range of skills, including:

- **Leadership.** We are experience leaders who are comfortable helping our
  teammates navigate ambiguity and uncertainty. We empower our teammates, and
  know when to step back and let someone else take the helm.
- **Vision setting.** We help people reconcile program goals, user needs, and
  technical constraints into a coherent and actionable vision for the future. We
  ensure that we are delivering the right product to the right people.
- **Product strategy and roadmapping.** We help people go from a high level
  vision to a concrete, but also flexible, plan of action.
- **Execution.** We lead teams through the software development process,
  ensuring that everyone stays aligned as we build.
- **Mentoring and coaching.** We help our partners build the skills to take
  complete ownership of their products, so that they aren't dependent on us in
  the long run.
- **Relationship Management:** We provide a clear point of accountability and
  ownership for project delivery and client relationships. We ensure projects
  are delivered within budget and according to the terms of the agreement, build
  trust-filled relationships with our partners, and spread 18F’s culture.

  [Product Welcome Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18YQtfLVb4klrZlUhKpZWYcDmM_PNKeYsWTPqMrcWcLE/edit#heading=h.3aypeb3a9sqy)
  explains how our projects typically play out and what you’ll want to know as a
  new 18F product management consultant going in.

- The [18F Product Guide](https://product-guide.18f.gov/) outlines the major
  outcomes an 18F product manager drives towards in different phases and
  elements of our work: discovery, delivering a product, consulting with
  partners, and coaching partners on product management.

# Joining the Product team

Welcome to the 18F Product team — we’re happy you’re here! We’ve compiled a set
of helpful tips to get you started.

## Onboarding

You first couple weeks at 18F will be all about onboarding. Check out the
[Product Welcome Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18YQtfLVb4klrZlUhKpZWYcDmM_PNKeYsWTPqMrcWcLE/edit#heading=h.3aypeb3a9sqy)
for a more detailed overview of what your first few weeks will look like.

## Who we are

The 18F Product team consists of experienced product managers. We come from a
variety of backgrounds, including government, non-profits, consultancies, and
corporations.

### Structure

As per the
[org chart](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/189TanLPSFF9MWvNr6VdfUvhBAWBSXeoCSGD2ZXRDm3s/edit#slide=id.g3f7d5fd6a1_2_81),
the product chapter consists of three sub-teams, which we refer to as
facilitation groups. Each facilitation group is led by a **supervisor** (which
we sometimes refer to as "supe"), and you will be assigned to a supervisor
during your first week. Supervisors work part-time on projects, and provide a
first level of managerial support for the product chapter. Your supervisor is
your first point of contact for support, project advice, and career discussions.
They also support the chapter director with staffing, hiring, training, and
cross-chapter initiatives. Supervisors are selected through a nomination and
review process that is open to anyone in the chapter.

Members of the product team are also assigned to **facilitation groups**. These
groups meet regularly to discuss work in progress, share learnings across
projects, and collaborate on chapter level initiatives. Facilitation groups are
aligned with supervisory groups; all PMs in a facilitation group share the same
supervisor. Facilitation groups can also include people outside of the 18F
Product chapter who want to participate in 18F's product community.

## What we do

Product managers at 18F have four primary objectives:

- **We do product well.** We are skilled product managers who deliver the right
  outcomes to the right people in the right ways.
- **We uphold 18F's values.** We help our teams follow best practices like
  iterative development, user-centered design, continuous delivery, inclusive
  design, and working in the open. We also ensure that both our work environment
  and our products are inclusive and compassionate.
- **We help our partners do product by themselves.** A product that dies when we
  walk away is a failed product. We make sure that our partners are able to
  successfully run their products long after we're done collaborating.
- **We turn our skills inwards, to uplift 18F and TTS.** We use our leadership,
  strategic sensibilities, and project management skills to improve our own
  organization. This doesn't necessarily mean starting new initiatives; often we
  are most impactful when we help our teammates carry internal projects across
  the finish line.

## How we work

### Rituals

Most of the product team works on a mix of partner projects and internal
initiatives, so everyone’s weeks look a little different. However, we make time
to get together regularly.

- **Wednesdays:** Every other week the product team meets for an hour starting
  at 11:30am PT / 2:30pm ET. The product leadership team shares reminders,
  announcements, and internal project updates. Members of the product team also
  take turns presenting things they've learned or facilitating conversations
  with the broader group. On alternating weeks, we either meet as facilitation
  groups, participate in Product Circle share outs, or have guest speakers join
  us.
- **Bi-weekly:** Meet with your supervisor. Bi-weekly, you'll have a 1:1 meeting
  with your supervisor at a time that works well for both of you. This meeting
  is both administrative and personal. It’s one of the main ways that the
  chapter leadership team tracks ongoing projects. It’s also a time for you to
  work through any project concerns, figure out how to wrangle the federal
  bureaucracy, and talk about how to make 18F work better for you.
- **At least once a month:** Meet with the chapter director. You'll have regular
  skip-level 1:1s with the director of product. This is an opportunity for you
  to talk about chapter initiatives and organizational events. It's also space
  for you to discuss opportunities and share your opinions.

### Communication channels

The product chapter communicates primarily in Slack. 18f-product@gsa.gov is a
low traffic Google group for all members of the product chapter. The chapter
director will add you to this list —- no need to worry about registering.

### Tools

[The TTS handbook lists the tools we use the most.]({% page "/#tools" %}) If you
can’t find what you need, reach out to your onboarding buddy or supervisor.

And one more thing: before you start using any new tool that asks for access to
files/browser data, see the [Software]({{base.baseurl}}/software/) page and
assure the tool is approved. If what you want to use isn’t there or not
approved, you’ll need to ask {% slack_channel "infrastructure" %} first.

Here are a few particularly useful essentials:

- **GitHub:** We use GitHub for source code management, version control, and
  project management. If you're not familiar with GitHub, let your supervisor
  know and they'll help you get up to speed.
- **Google Docs, Drive, and Slides:** We often need to collaborate on documents
  and slide decks, and we do that through Google's productivity apps.
- **18F templates:** You can get our document and slide templates through
  [18F's Visual Identity Guide](https://brand.18f.gov/templates). Please don't
  make major changes to the base templates; start a conversation in
  {% slack_channel "#18f-branding" %} instead!
- **Mural:** We use [Mural]({% page "/tools/mural/" %}) as a collaborative
  whiteboard and sticky note tool. It's a particularly useful tool for
  brainstorming with distributed teams.
