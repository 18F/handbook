**Mission:** We exist to make TTS more productive and secure, empowering our staff and programs to better deliver on their missions.

**Vision:** We strive to make TTS the model for how to do IT in government: human-centered, transparent, and as a force-multiplier for the organization(s) we serve.

We oversee/manage/coordinate everything technology-related that cuts across TTS, and anything technology-related that will affect TTS from the outside: particularly security, compliance, infrastructure, and tech policy. We provide all the things that allow you to get your job done, at the highest quality level.

Rather than trying to exert control over everything technology at TTS, we focus instead on protecting, streamlining, and enabling our staff and systems, and doing so in an empathetic, transparent way. The Tech Portfolioâ€™s work applies to much more than technology; it applies to our entire operation, including how we work inside the law, how we secure our systems, and how we spend money. We also:

- Find where we may be duplicating effort or have gaps around technology, and if those are opportunities for TTS/GSA/government-wide shared services
- Serve as the primary liaison between [GSA IT](https://www.gsa.gov/about-us/organization/gsa-it) and TTS, ensuring high levels of service, finding compromise, and generally keeping a good relationship between the teams

## Areas of work

- **Compliance:** Assist in [authorization](https://atos.open-control.org/steps/#step-5-authorize-information-system) of TTS systems to get their ATOs, improving that process along the way
- **IT Security:** Involved in [security incidents]({{site.baseurl}}/security-incidents/) triage and reporting
- **Requirements:** In coordination with GSA IT, manage and support procurements, approvals, and licenses (with Acquisition and Finance teams) for [hardware]({{site.baseurl}}/equipment/) and [software]({{site.baseurl}}/software/) that chapters need to accomplish their mission
- **Assets:** Manage major [TTS infrastructure](https://before-you-ship.18f.gov/infrastructure/) and programs such as [Bug Bounty](https://hackerone.com/tts), [AWS](https://before-you-ship.18f.gov/infrastructure/aws/), New Relic, Twilio, etc.
- **Relationships:** Advise TTS leadership and interface with the rest of GSA (FAS, OGP, GSA IT Security, etc) on technology-related matters.
- **Customer Service:** Generally support TTS on any technology-related matters
- **Administration:** Perform operational activities like access, account and license management.

### FSGC

TTS sits within the [Federal Acquisition Service (FAS)](https://www.gsa.gov/about-us/organization/federal-acquisition-service), and the Tech Portfolio Director represents TTS as the voting member on the [FAS Systems Governance Committee (FSGC)](https://sites.google.com/a/gsa.gov/fas-systems-governance/). This body decides on what groups in FAS get funding from the [Acquisition Services Fund (ASF)](https://www.gsa.gov/reference/reports/budget-performance/annual-reports/agency-financial-report-2012/managements-discussion-and-analysis/financial-statements-analysis-and-summary/financial-results-by-major-fund-acquisition-services-fund) for new/expanded technology initiatives.

#### Voting considerations

TTS' votes mainly focusing on technology/product aspects, following the [18F De-Risking Guide](https://derisking-guide.18f.gov/federal-field-guide/). We will generally defer to other voting members on alignment with other initiatives, etc.

- If this is a `New Investment`:
  - Cost should be under $10M, ideally under $5M
    - Based on [Standish Group report](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/techtank/2015/08/25/doomed-challenges-and-solutions-to-government-it-projects/) that only 6.4% of federal IT projects with labor costs > $10 million were "successful" (on time, in budget, satisfactory, and ultimately used)
- If this is an `Amendment`, looking for:
  - Evidence that users (outside the team) have deemed the previous phase(s) a success
    - E.g. quotes from usability research participants
  - A demo
- Should plan for and then show live, usable deliverables every six months (incremental delivery)
- Showing reasonable options for what could be done for lower cost

## Out of scope

- Purchasing office equipment for individuals (rather than the project the individual supports)
- Picking up software development tasks for TTS programs
- Being the owners/stewards/pushers of data/metrics for TTS, beyond what applies to responsibilities listed above
