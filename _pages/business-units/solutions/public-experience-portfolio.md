## Our Mission

Our mission is to create and organize timely, needed government information and services and make them accessible anytime, anywhere, via the public's channel of choice.

## Our Channels

USAGov is an omnichannel platform. We communicate with the public on the websites [USA.gov](https://www.usa.gov/), [USAGov en Español](https://www.usa.gov/espanol/), and [Vote.gov](https://vote.gov/).

Through the [USAGov Contact Center](https://www.usa.gov/contact), we answer phone calls and chats in English and Spanish for our own program, as well as for customer agencies who reimburse us to answer calls, chats, and/or emails for their programs.

We disseminate government information by email in English and Spanish; and reach and engage with the public through social media channels that include:

- [USAGov on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/USAGov/)

## Our Unique Value

USAGov aggregates information across federal government programs and services. This gives us a unique vantage point on some of the public’s top government needs, and has helped us to become a trusted source for accessible, user-centered, accurate, neutral, and timely content.

We share lessons learned, best practices, and [data](https://www.usa.gov/website-analytics) with our government partners; and [support other agencies](https://connect.usa.gov/digital-toolkit-ready-to-work) to help them amplify their messages through public outreach efforts.
