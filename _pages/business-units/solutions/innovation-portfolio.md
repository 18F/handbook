title: Innovation Portfolio
---

The Innovation Portfolio (IP) operates within GSA as part of the Technology Transformation Services (TTS) in the Office of Solutions (TTS Solutions). As a portfolio nested within an office, IP builds from the base missions of TTS and Solutions, as well as GSA overall. 

## Our Mission

IPâ€™s mission is to help agencies better understand the public and their interactions with government. We provide centralized resources, communities, and training that make the government more innovative, efficient, and digitally-focused.

Specifically, we: 
 
- Help agencies implement digital and innovation policies and initiatives, many of which are executive- and congressionally-mandated; 
- Serve as a connection point between digital practitioners, change agents, innovation hubs, and idea labs across government to collaborate, prototype, share, and learn. 

## Our Channels

Each IP program advances our mission of supporting technology innovation opportunities, as well as fostering communities of contributors that support agency missions. 
 
We have two main focus areas: digital innovation, and open innovation.
