TTS Talent attracts the most passionate, talented individuals from across the public and private sectors, offering them unique professional development opportunities, top-notch customer service, and fulfilling, impactful work that transforms how the public interacts with the government.

While the name might be misleading, the Talent Team is primarily focused on talent acquisition/hiring and onboarding, whereas the People Ops team is focused on assisting current employees with issues related to benefits, performance management, and learning and development opportunities.

## Talent Team Overview

### Our Mission

To cultivate an organization full of highly talented and diverse staff who are provided the opportunity to deliver high impact public service.

### How We Work

We are a team that works collaboratively, transparently and vulnerably. Where everyone has a role to play but success is not determined by an individualâ€™s output, it is determined by the whole team delivering on the mission.

### Team Values

- Teamwork
- User-Centric, iterative & agile
- Measureable & data driven
- Open by default
- Be great to work with
- Innovative Solutions

### FY2020 Key Objectives

1. Acquire the people that TTS needs to deliver on the work to transform the Federal Government
2. Set the bar for candidate experience within the Federal Government
3. Attract and hire well-qualified candidates who reflect the diversity of the general public

### Our Commitment to DE&I

We acknowledge that we can do better as a team and as an organization when it comes to attracting and hiring talent from underrepresented backgrounds. In Summer 2020, we launched a [MVP for Improving Diversity, Equity and Inclusion](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1E1F84W8werC12RVdLp4-8OLZFgI0d2sVDIo7SYe3Z_I/edit#) in our hiring process. We are committed to continuing to iterate and improve on our strategy.

## Referring a person

Many leads for great candidates come through our current employees. Ideally, **these referrals should come directly to Talent rather than to the team/managers/supervisors**. We try to keep all mentions of who knows who and who recommends who away from the team/managers/supervisors who are involved in hiring so they can stay impartial. This helps ensure that candidates make it through the process on their own merits.

We accept varying levels of leads including:

- Referrals: You know them really well (e.g. someone you worked closely with or a good friend)
- Warm Leads: You kind-of know them (e.g. someone you worked with but not directly)
- Cold Leads: You barely know them at all (e.g. someone you heard speak at a conference or wrote a memorable blog post)

Submit leads and referrals using the [Referral Submission Form](https://goo.gl/forms/I6cOnRNdh21aP5e63). [More information on the referral program.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GY57s0tXahSwTaLzHEuR6falwQcNh7nbCnRnLoQppdQ/edit) Leads and referrals are welcome any time, not just during times when positions are open.
