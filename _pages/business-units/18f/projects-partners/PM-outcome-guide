# Product Management Outcomes Guide

üèÅ üîê üèÅ FRONT MATTER  üèÅ üîê üèÅ 
Goals of this document:
- Clearly describe the outcomes a product manager drives toward at 18F across different phases of our work 
- Offer staff a common vocabulary and understanding of product management at 18F
- Use this to baseline Product Management performance goals and help assess our individual strengths, growth areas and  work
- Fill a gap on product management topics to add to other 18F working guides in Project Resources

People who have worked on this: Nikki Lee, Uchenna Moka-Solana, Alicia Rouault, Andrew Suprenant, Greg Walker

Former 18F staff: Lawrence Bafundo, Michael Torres 

Initial intended audience: Product Chapter, 18F staff working with PMs, new hires 

Status [date]: Ready for feedback from Product Chapter 

How to use: The doc starts with thing 18F has the most control over and ends with things we have the least control over. 

Guide: Product Management at 18F 
This is an outline of the major outcomes an 18F product manager drives toward in different phases and elements of our work: discovery, delivering product, consulting with partners, and coaching partners on product management. 
Discovery as a PM
Goal: Ensure the team has identified and understands the right problem(s) to solve to satisfy user and business needs.
Define the problem
Surface the major challenges and articulate the problem statements
Understand and articulate the impact of the problem (who is affected and by how much)
Identify a high-value part of the problem that can be delivered within a timeframe that the partner and team feels comfortable with
Identify the audiences affected by the problem
Validate the problem by user and/or market research
Get key stakeholders on board and committed to solving the problem
Document the problem throughout implementation and keep it visible and central. Refer to it regularly.
Regularly reconsider the problem, as appropriate, and update related documentation


Create a vision
The high-level vision exists and is well-documented
The vision is aspirational yet achievable (see example deck)
The vision supports the broader goals of the organization
The vision ties back to the problem statement
The development team, executive sponsors, and any other key participants are all on board with and committed to the vision
There are measurable outcomes that communicate the positive impact of the intended changes
The vision is regularly reconsidered and updated as appropriate


Develop a strategy
Clearly articulate accessible short-term and long-term goals that tie into achieving the vision 
Develop goals that are measurable, flexible, adaptable, and subject to change based on external input or new direction
Include the project team and partner in developing the strategy
Identify, inform, and engage stakeholders that can provide additional resources, including decisions around legal/policy, compliance, technical, or security matters
Be ready to speak to the value of the proposed product or service to a variety of audiences
Think about market differentiation as it relates to your product‚Äôs value proposition (e.g. competitors, build/buy analysis, existing systems, how tech changed over time, etc.)
Regularly reconsider the strategy and update related documentation as appropriate


Build a roadmap
Develop a plausible plan for achieving the long-term goals (e.g. roadmap) that informs a pragmatic plan for achieving the short-term goals (e.g. backlog)
Estimate the level of effort needed to achieve short-term goals and identify the potential value. Short-term goals should feed into an actionable backlog.
Articulate known dependencies and risks at both the short-term and long-term levels 
Create a roadmap that‚Äôs understandable to key stakeholders who are able to explain it to others
Make sure the roadmap tracks back to measurable outcomes (metrics) that support the strategy and vision
Adjust the roadmap based on validated learning, feedback, and new information throughout development
Delivery as a PM
Goal: Ensure the team builds the thing right.
Define the relationship with the Product Owner (PO) during the engagement 
PO should have a sufficient capacity to perform their role 
PO should clearly understand their role and responsibilities
PO and leadership should clarify which decisions the PO can make independently (e.g. feature prioritization and scope that support the agreed-upon goals and strategy) and which decisions the PO will decide with leadership (e.g. recommended changes to goals, metrics, and launch strategy)  
PO should feel empowered to make decisions that support the development process
PO should own and advocate for the Product Vision
PO understands that they're wearing the "hat of the user" and advocates on the user‚Äôs behalf
PO understands the coaching relationship with the 18F team and Product Manager


Build the product
Identify the Minimally Viable Product (MVP) from the roadmap with a focus on ‚Äúmust haves,‚Äù or non-negotiable functionality that will deliver a high value to end users 
Break the initial MVP into small, prioritized features that deliver value to the end user 
Tie the features back to the user value and write them from the perspective of an end user 
Give actionable acceptance criteria to user stories and make sure they meet the INVEST standard prior to beginning the work
Refer to data and research when making prioritization decisions
Evaluate key risks, assumptions, constraints, and dependencies, and have a mitigation plan in place for significant risks
Triage, prioritize, and estimate the work (eg. stories, defects, tasks) with the PO
Evaluate user stories to make sure they meet acceptance criteria 
Use authorized tools/platforms (via FedRAMP, when possible) to support desired build methodology and get an ATO if necessary
Test features with real users to ensure their needs are met


Team collaboration and communication
The team and stakeholders understand the iterative, incremental, and user-centric approach
The team understands and has documented ‚ÄúDefinition of Done‚Äù for working together and building functionality
The team has a shared understanding of high quality work (using design principles, accessibility standards, etc.) and holds the work to these standards
Define, document, and validate practices‚Äîincluding unit tests, integration tests, and functional tests‚Äîat every sprint
Establish and schedule core ceremonies/meetings and make sure the team understands the value of such meetings
Make sure the code that‚Äôs destined for production is sustainably-paced and not accumulating technical debt
The team has a shared understanding of where, when, and how to communicate with each other 
The project team understands the state of the project at all times
Key stakeholders understand the state of the project at all times
Key stakeholders know how they can contribute to the project as well as how to effectively give feedback to the project team 
Regularly reflect/retro on what's working well and how the team can improve
Articulate lessons from the project and share them across TTS (stretch)


Measure success
Goals, outcomes, and targets have appropriate, realistic measures indicating how we‚Äôll know when they‚Äôre met
Use these metrics to forecast and adjust the trajectory of the project
The state of the project can be reported in terms of measurable indicators  at any time


Deploy to real users
Develop a rollout strategy (including documentation and training) to get the product into users‚Äô hands, whether we help the partner deploy or they have to do it in our absence
Develop a strategy for collecting (and synthesizing) user feedback
Team leadership as a PM
Goal: The team feels empowered and aligned, and works autonomously to accelerate delivery of value to our partners.
Team leadership
Facilitate a culture where team members feel comfortable sharing feedback about all aspects of the project
Lead with a servant leadership style and share power
Set clear roles/responsibility expectations with team members so everyone understands how their work supports the vision
Configure the team so it‚Äôs balanced and allows each person‚Äôs expertise to contribute to the vision
Work with the team to plan work each cadence and know how this supports development goals
Incorporate feedback as part of the team culture
Facilitate discussions around tradeoffs to design and engineering decisions, and seek team‚Äôs consensus on the best path forward
Unblock team members when they don‚Äôt understand what they should be doing
Find opportunities for team members to deepen or broaden their skills
Consulting with partners as a PM
Goal: Deliver value to the client or customer. (Though you don‚Äôt have full control over consulting outcomes as a PM, you should strive to check these boxes, but are not held solely accountable.)

Communication
The 18F team models working in the open (platform-based collaboration, default to transparency) to enable partner learning
TTS has access to a record of the work being completed
The partner:
Can articulate what the project team will accomplish and why 
Understands what they‚Äôll need to contribute to the project for it to succeed 
Understands the time commitment expected of them and their SMEs
Seeks, surfaces, acknowledges, and addresses concerns and anxieties
Has regular access to the status of planned and completed work, significant risks, and opportunities so they can ask questions or give feedback to the project team


Managing up and out
The project team can successfully identify and mobilize to secure resources it needs to succeed (or raises this as a significant project risk)
Leadership, the partner, and other key stakeholders understand and can articulate the value of the work 
Partners understand and can articulate key risks to the project and how they are being addressed
Executive leadership within the partner organization is able to articulate these risks and possible mitigations 
TTS leadership is able to articulate these risks and possible mitigations


Business development
Identify pathways to new opportunities to help account management extend current IAA, whether PA to EI or modification of current EIs 
Find opportunities to integrate execution of roadmap with other TTS-wide services/products (Federalist, login, cloud.gov)
Coaching partners as a PM
Goal: Meet partners where they‚Äôre at to learn and practice new ways of working, aligning with industry best practices (e.g. agile, user-centered design, working in the open). 
The product owner:
Is allocated to work on the project (at least 50% time) for the duration of the engagement
Is trained in core product management practices most valuable to them (e.g. strategic product thinking, scrum, cross-functional team management)
Has hands-on experience making decisions about the product
Understands how to further develop their product management skills
Demonstrates a product-oriented mindset (action over philosophy, testing hypotheses, learning from failure, embrace experimentation, iteration, and uncertainty, etc.)


The partner values, understands, and begins to demonstrate transformative practices including:
Product thinking
User-centered design
Core XP (extreme programming) practices, particularly continuous integration and deployment, test-driven development, and DevSecOps
Working in the open
User testing
Business analysis


Transitioning the project
Include a plan in the roadmap to transition ownership over to the partner 
Include specific target outcomes for the transition related to iterative development, continuous deployment to end users, working with stakeholders, and technical leadership
Give appropriate metrics for each transition outcome
Transition responsibility over to the partner as soon as possible (well before final weeks of work when possible)
Plan to transition code and assets to accounts the partner has access to


Organizational culture
Partners understand the value of PMs in developing products
Executive leadership within the partner organization supports partner PMs to make and execute on strategic decisions
Partners and their executive leadership understand and can articulate the type of talent needed to staff the product


Sustainability
