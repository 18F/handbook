Qualtrics is GSA’s enterprise survey management tool and is the only approved application for external feedback collection projects.

## Getting a Qualtrics license

Any TTS employee may request a license from GSA’s Office of Customer Experience (OCE) by [emailing OCE](mailto:customerexperience@gsa.gov). Please make sure to state your business case in your request, including the expected number of responses per year, so that OCE can advise on any potential cost implications

Qualtrics can only be used if you’re collecting feedback that is directly helping GSA; not another agency. For example: if you’re working with NIH, you cannot collect data for NIH using GSA’s Qualtrics account.

Please use Google Forms if you’re only collecting feedback from people with GSA emails.

## Logging into Qualtrics

Qualtrics can be accessed at [feedback.gsa.gov](https://feedback.gsa.gov) via single sign-on on the GSA network or 2-factor authentication using your ENT credentials.

OCE requires new license holders to **attend their weekly office hours within a month of getting a license**, to get an overview on how to work the platform and requirements for usage. Office Hours are held every Wednesday at 12 PM ET. [Email OCE](mailto:customerexperience@gsa.gov) to get a calendar invite.

If you plan to not use Qualtrics for long periods of time, it's advisable to set-up a calendar invite to **log into Qualtrics once every 9 weeks** otherwise you'll be locked out of your account.

## Resources to get started

OCE’s [Survey Checklist](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f5wkHrw5UPsZGKbPJbXOzysvDMeDr5RvzHLjoFOnX1U/edit) contains instructions on how to make your survey accessible and user-friendly. These items must be completed before distributing.

[Qualtrics Support Pages](https://www.qualtrics.com/support/) have robust video and text resources that answer "How do I do this?" questions.

[Qualtrics On-Demand Webinars](https://www.qualtrics.com/support/trainings-and-webinars/on-demand-webinars/) are also really useful. OCE recommends the Learn to Use Research Core. This login is shared by all Qualtrics users at GSA, so please do not change [the user name or password](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yXy1k3wjH8NCI3SZPy3BhuoLItKJjUT3h_kKs2I6UoE/edit?usp=sharing).

Information on feedback collection at GSA can be found on [OCE’s insite page](https://insite.gsa.gov/services-and-offices/staff-offices/office-of-customer-experience/surveys-and-feedback-collection).

## Website Intercept Technical Documentation

If you’re planning to add a site-intercept onto your website, Qualtrics has [supporting documentation](https://www.qualtrics.com/support/website-app-feedback/getting-started-with-website-app-feedback/website-app-feedback-technical-documentation/).

## Getting help

If you run into technical issues or need help, come to OCE Office Hours. Otherwise, you can contact Qualtrics Support by clicking on the "Help" tab in the top right corner of your account. When prompted to sign in, choose the "Sign in with SSO" option, and enter GSA's organization ID as CEMGSA.

## Best practices

While you’re testing your survey for accessibility and usability, use the [preview link](https://www.qualtrics.com/support/survey-platform/survey-module/preview-survey/). This is because GSA’s Qualtrics contract has a max number of audible responses. Responses received from the preview link are not audible responses, and thus don’t affect the Qualtrics contract.

Follow the [Survey Checklist](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f5wkHrw5UPsZGKbPJbXOzysvDMeDr5RvzHLjoFOnX1U/edit). It’ll cover most of the grounds to get through OCE approval and making sure your survey is as accessible as possible.

## Survey approval

Please note that all Qualtrics projects must be reviewed and approved by OCE before being distributed. Please use [this form](https://feedback.gsa.gov/jfe/form/SV_bw48jGEVifGRXjT) to submit a survey request. OCE requires 5 business days for the initial review. Depending on the size and scope of the survey, an additional review may be necessary.

## Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA)

If you’re collecting feedback from more than 10 people outside of the Federal Government, your survey will need to go through PRA approval. The whole process takes 3-4 weeks with approvals from not only OCE, but also GSA’s Office of Government-Wide Policy (OGP), Legal, and finally The Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) at the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). More information can be found in the [PRA Digital Guide](https://pra.digital.gov/).

## Offboarding

Please [email OCE](mailto:customerexperience@gsa.gov) if you need to transfer your account to someone else, if you’re leaving GSA, or if you no longer need your account.
