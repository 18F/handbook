[Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) is a cloud-based container registry for
use with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and other container technologies.

## How do I get access to Docker Hub?

You may use your personal Docker Hub account for work. Ask
[#infrastructure][slack-infrastructure] for access to
the [TTS-wide account](https://hub.docker.com/u/18fgsa).

Alternatively, you can create a Docker Hub Organization for your program and use a [micropurchase
request]({{site.baseurl}}/purchase-requests/) for payment. Please start the
request in [#infrastructure][slack-infrastructure].

## For admins

Ensure the user has been removed from the [Members
list](https://hub.docker.com/orgs/18fgsa).
