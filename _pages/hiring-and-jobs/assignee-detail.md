A detail is when a person in one agency goes to work at another agency on a temporary, time-specific, and limited basis.

## Definitions

- ***A Detail***: The temporary assignment of an employee to another person, within or outside GSA, for a specified time period.
- ***An Assignee***: someone coming into 18F that does not require an MOA (USDS)
- ***Servicing Agency***: Agency who is providing the employee
- ***Receiving Agency***: Agency who is gaining the employee/where employee is being detailed to
- ***Non-reimbursable detail***: An agreement whereby one organization temporarily loans an employee/detailee to another organization without requiring repayment for the costs of the services rendered
- ***Reimbursable detail***: An agreement whereby one organization temporarily loans an employee/detailee to another organization who is subsequently required to provide repayment for the costs of the services rendered

## What you should know about Details

* The Assistant Commissioner of your office must approve every detail request. Once The detail is approved it is the supervisor's responsibility to notify [TTS-PeopleOps@gsa.gov](mailto:TTS-PeopleOps@gsa.gov) and [Finance](mailto:18F-Finance-CS@gsa.gov) of the request.
* All details of GSA employees to other Federal agencies or departments should be reimbursable. Details within GSA may be reimbursable or non-reimbursable.
* Non reimbursable details to external agencies are done on a case by case basis and must be reviewed by GSA’s Office of General Counsel for compliance with the [Antideficiency Act](https://www.gao.gov/legal/appropriations-law-decisions/resources).
* Most agencies use the [7600A](https://drive.google.com/a/gsa.gov/file/d/0BynxjBcHPLcLcEMxVzlzRUYyeG8/view?usp=sharing) and [7600B](https://drive.google.com/a/gsa.gov/file/d/0BynxjBcHPLcLYTQ0T0ZNOGhoc0E/view?usp=sharing) forms, but some do not and require a memorandum of understanding (MOU) only.  If an agency chooses not to use the forms, then the MOU will need to contain the information in the 7600A and B forms.
* The Servicing Agency initiates the paperwork.
* The agreement is between agencies, not between staff and the receiving agency.
* Employees can refer to [GSA Order HRM 9334.2 Detail of Employees](https://drive.google.com/a/gsa.gov/file/d/1pCfXxK3vnPZOKaXxlyOC9EozXLRvHw4L/view?usp=sharing) dated July 8, 2016.
* People Ops will keep the Supervisor, including the potential detailee, apprised of the status of action on an ongoing basis.
* Detail agreements come in increments of 120 days or less and can be extended up to one time for a total period of no more than 240 days. All details must be approved by the assistant commissioner of the requesting organization.

## Security Verification

All Federal employees working at GSA must have a security clearance. For those employees detailing into TTS from outside of GSA, their security status must be verified with the GSA Security Office.

It is the **responsibility of the TTS employee supervising the detailee** to ensure this is complete. People Ops provides step-by-step instructions on how to complete the security process. This process should be completed at the same time as the detail agreement process. For more information, visit the [TTS security verification steps form](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xX4ro1bm4TtcJpqoz0TbXlpDhiaxLf4coBFg61GPQ9g/edit#heading=h.1jfe24syhsou).

## Detailing within TTS/GSA

1. In order for People Ops to process the request, the employee’s Supervisor must have approvals from the AC of their office and the AC/Head of the office the employee will be detailed to

2. Once those approvals are granted, the Supervisor should contact [TTS-PeopleOps@gsa.gov](mailto:TTS-PeopleOps@gsa.gov) with the request and cc: [Finance](mailto:18F-Finance-CS@gsa.gov) for awareness. That email will need to contain the following information:
   * Employee Name
   * Office Symbol Employee is being detailed to
   * Reimbursable or Non-reimbursable
   * Detail Supervisor
   * Detail PD or “Unclassified Set of Duties”
   * Effective Date 

3. People Ops will submit the personnel action to HR and the employee will begin their detail on the effective date

4. The detail can only be for a time period of no more than 120 days. However, the detail can be extended for another 120 days If the HM and the employee’s supervisor both agree to extend.
