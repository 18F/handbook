Be sure to stay informed of current job postings relevant to technology transformation in TTS and with other agencies by joining the [#tts-jobs](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/messages/tts-jobs/) Slack channel. If you want to be notified about opportunities with other federal agencies please join the [#wg-govcareer](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/messages/wg-govcareer) Slack channel. We encourage TTS staff to post external federal career opportunities on the [#wg-govcareer](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/messages/wg-govcareer) Slack channel to help others be aware of permanent, career opportunities.
