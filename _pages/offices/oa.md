Welcome to TTS Office of Acquisition (OA) team page!

## Our Mission

We seek to design and evangelize acquisition approaches that are better aligned with current industry best practices to ensure 
the successful delivery of technology products and services that truly meet the needs of TTS, our agency partners, and the 
people they serve. 

## Our Approach

In pursuit of our mission, we incorporate the following practices:

* Applying agile and human-centered practices to help government buy better technology
* Reducing time and costs
* Starting small and iterating
* Creating cross-functional teams
* Focusing on the user need
* Working in the open and being transparent
* Following the appropriate federal and agency-specific rules and regulations

## What We Do

We buy digital products and services for TTS as well as for partner agencies (coming soon through assisted acquisitions).

### TTS Internal Procurement

If you are within TTS and your procurement need costs less than the micro-purchase threshold ($10,000), please visit the 
[Purchase Requests]({{site.baseurl}}/purchase-requests) section in the handbook. For SaaS purchases under $10,000 please visit the 
[Software]({{site.baseurl}}/software) section. 

If you are within TTS and your procurement need costs more than the micro-purchase threshold ($10,000), please visit the 
[Procurements over $10,000]({{site.baseurl}}/procurements-over-10000) section in the handbook.

### TTS Assisted Acquisition

Procurement of services and/or products over $10k that will partially or fully support your partner(s) outside of TTS (including other GSA offices and partner agencies), paid partially or fully by your partner(s), will be considered an assisted acquisition. 

However, OA is currently set up as a shared service, so please keep in mind that we cannot work directly with outside partners. In order for us to do an assisted acquisition, the request must come through one of the following TTS Business Units (BU). Also note that each BU has its own assisted acquisition process as well as vetting criteria. Please contact the following BUs for more information and/or to get started:

- [18F](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1RIxGEtQ4vMEfcdx8JYXQ_U5-uTMTu1Ffi-UNur1XKHQ/edit#slide=id.p) - Inquiries18F@gsa.gov
- OPP - Slack [#opp](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/messages/tts-oa)
- [CoE](https://coe.gsa.gov/) - ConnectCoE@gsa.gov

## TTS OA Operational Guidance

TTS OA aims to redefine the culture of government acquisition of information technology by bringing agile practices to service
level procurement policies. [TTS OA Operational Guidance](https://handbook.18f.gov/acquisition/), which includes standard 
operating procedures, #readmeâ€™s, templates, checklists and other operational guidance documents, were established to keep TTS
procurement practices agile, current, applicable and in compliance at the Federal, Agency and Service levels.
