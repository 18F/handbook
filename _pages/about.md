In a nutshell, the Handbook is our take on internal government documentation. It is an open, crowd-sourced, accessible, and living resource that aims to provide the information our team needs to do their work.

The Handbook does **not** represent official TTS policy. At times, the Handbook may summarize official policy in plain-language, but it is not used as an enforcement tool from HR or others.

## Principles

The Handook should always aim to be:

- **Open**: To build trust among TTS staff members, with the public, and to make the information as easy-to-access as possible, content should be open to all.
- **Crowd-sourced**: Anyone should be able to contribute. Contributors should not need to know web development or version control, and they should not have to be affiliated with TTS.
- **Accessible**: Handbook content ought to be written in plain language and be searchable.
- **Living**: Content is expected to change over time. Specifically, it should be kept up-to-date with TTSâ€™s processes and policies.
