**If this is a press request (newspaper, TV station, radio station, podcast, or blog) forward the request to [press@gsa.gov](press@gsa.gov) and do not respond directly. OSC will handle responding, coordinating, and gaining the necessary approvals.**

We want you to share your expertise and represent TTS/GSA, and we want the approval process to be as seamless, transparent, and speedy as possible. We understand this process is complex. If you have questions or want additional information, please reach out to #trainings-conferences in Slack or via email at [tts-events@gsa.gov](tts-events@gsa.gov). We also have a help [slide](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1k8DazgKibsgN5e3kyfghGeAEAqDET251-sV71UrkGNk/edit?usp=sharing) and [office hours](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/selfsched?sstoken=UUtoczVQMkFlT2FSfGRlZmF1bHR8OTE5Y2UyMDBjYzlhMWY4NjkxNThkMmI5ZGI4ZWMzMmM).

Speaking externally in your official capacity is a privilege, as you are representing GSA and your fellow TTSers. There is an approval process. GSA’s Office of Strategic Communications (OSC) and TTS Outreach must approve your participation, talking points, and presentation materials before you can participate in any external events.

This playbook contains the most recently updated speaking guidelines. It’s the best place to start whenever you have the opportunity to speak. If it's your first engagement or if you haven't been on the speaking circuit for a while, schedule a run-through with [TTS Outreach](tts-outreach@gsa.gov) once your request has been approved.
This process has four major steps and can take up to 3-6 weeks to complete. Here is a breakdown of the 4 major steps.

<Summary> Step 2: Decide if you should be speaking</summary>

If you have been formally invited to participate in a speaking engagement, you need to think through the following questions.

<li>Do you have time?</li>
<li>Does the event fit fully within your realm of expertise? Is there someone else at TTS that may be a better fit for this speaking opportunity?</li>
<li>Have you reviewed the Event Justification Examples?</li>
<li>Does the event reflect TTS and your team’s larger mission?</li>
<li>Are you clear how speaking on this topic to this audience in this forum advances TTS and your team?</li>
</ul>
Critical questions that you need to address before submitting a speaker event request.

<ul>
<li>Are you submitting a proposal for an event or conference?</li>
<li>Is a colleague better suited to speaking on this topic?</li>
<li>Are there any sensitivities that may preclude you from speaking publicly?</li>
<li>Is this event not inclusive or representative of our TTS diversity?</li>
<li>Is this event scheduled for less than 15 days from now?</li>
<li>If you answer yes to any of these questions, stop here and contact your direct supervisor or TTS Outreach.</li>
</ul>
