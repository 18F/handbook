## Common goals of an IDP

- Learn new skills and competencies to improve current job performance
- Maximize current performance in support of organizational requirements
- Assist employees in reaching career development goals.
- Increase interest, challenge, and satisfaction in current position
- Obtain knowledge, skills, and abilities necessary for a change in grade, series, or fields

## IDPs and conference, event, and training requests

An IDP is no longer required for requests, but an SF-182 is required for most conference, event, and training requests that have a cost.

For more information on the SF-182 process, head over to the [Conferences, events, and training handbook page]({{site.baseurl}}/training-and-development/conferences-events-training/#creating-an-sf-182-required-for-most-conference-event-and-training-requests-that-have-a-cost).
