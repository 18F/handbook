You can get started with a trial version [immediately](https://www.sketch.com/). Upgrade to the full version whenever you get the license. Visit [#sketch](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/messages/sketch) on Slack for help and sharing tips.

## Getting a license

Send an email to [tts-software@gsa.gov](mailto:tts-software@gsa.gov) with:

- Your [Mac serial number](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201581)
- Your [computer name](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/find-your-computers-name-and-network-address-mchlp1177/mac)
- If you've used Sketch at TTS before

Note Sketch is registered to the machine, so this needs to be done if you get a new one.

### For admins

Once you get the email above:

1. Check the seat count to make sure there is room
   1. [Request an access code](https://www.sketch.com/license/admin/) for [tts-software@gsa.gov](mailto:tts-software@gsa.gov).
   1. You should get an email from Sketch. Click through to log into the License Manager.
      - If it doesn't come through, ask an admin to [review pending messages](https://groups.google.com/a/gsa.gov/forum/#!pendingmsg/18fsoftware).
1. Check the existing [user list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SCkLr0GXgoeqmIMPLic8QnX1INkyoP1YCNp17Sarx9s/edit#gid=243236610) to make sure they don't have an existing license. If it's in there, delete their old one from both the user list and the License Manager.
1. [Share the license key](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Qrn4J7mOcpGv51krZOyxpz93mBDp22hzl2wtVLulhUU/edit) with the requester.
1. Add them to the user list.

## Plugins

One thing that's different about using Sketch at GSA is that Sketch plugins are not impossible to obtain, but might be more time-consuming than time-saving. Each Sketch plugin is treated like a [new software request]({{site.baseurl}}/software/), and must undergo review by GSA IT review. So far, we haven't found much that we can't accomplish without plugins.
