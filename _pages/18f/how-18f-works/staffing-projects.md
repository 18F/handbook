18F partner projects and 10x projects are staffed using a process outlined in the [staffing repo](https://github.com/18F/staffing).
The staffing repo README details specific processes for staffing new projects, changing staffing on in-flight projects, and making "microrequests" (requests that are for fewer than eight total hours of work per week overall).
