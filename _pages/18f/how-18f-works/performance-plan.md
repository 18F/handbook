[Performance plans](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/performance-management/performance-management-cycle/planning/a-checklist-for-performance-plans/) are documents we use to communicate expectations, structure feedback, and evaluate employee performance during our annual review cycle (which aligns with the government [fiscal year](https://www.senate.gov/reference/glossary_term/fiscal_year.htm)).
