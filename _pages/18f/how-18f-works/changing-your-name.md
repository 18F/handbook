TTS does our best to make everyone feel welcome. During the onboarding process, we can't always ensure that your preferred name is reflected in all of GSA's systems. You can update your records so that people who look at your name on emails and in Google Meet are reminded to use the name that makes you most comfortable.

## Changing your name across GSA

Follow these steps to update your name if your *legal* name changes/does not match GSA systems:

1. Log in to the [GSA network or a VPN]({{ site.baseurl }}/how-to-log-in/)
1. Follow [these steps](https://corporateapps.gsa.gov/files/HR-Links-Guide_-Changing-Your-Name_Final-Oct-2020docx.pdf).
1. Wait up to 5 business days for the changes to take effect. You will receive an automated email from HR links stating that it has been submitted.
1. Once your name has been updated in GCIMS via HRLinks, you can submit a GSA IT Help Desk to update your google account.

If you have trouble with this process, [contact HRLinks support](https://corporateapps.gsa.gov/hr-links/hr-links-support/).


## Adding a preferred name

Follow these steps to update your *preferred* first name if it does not match your legal name (e.g. your legal name is Michael but you go by Mike):
