Here, you'll find a list of tools folks at TTS use to schedule meetings, along with information about some specific meetings at TTS.

## Meeting tools

Here are some of the tools TTS uses to facilitate meetings:

For scheduling, use [Google Calendar]({{site.baseurl}}/google-calendar/). See also: [collaboration tools]({{site.baseurl}}/collaboration-tools/).

### Videoconferencing

See [InSite](https://insite.gsa.gov/employee-resources/information-technology/do-it-yourself-self-help/virtual-and-online-meetings). Additional option not listed there:

| Service                                                                             | Capacity                                                                         | Dial-in option? |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| [Slack calls](https://slack.com/help/articles/115003498363-Slack-Calls--the-basics) | [15](https://slack.com/help/articles/216771908-Make-calls-in-Slack#start-a-call) | N               |

The ones with dial-in options can be used without video (say, if video is blocked by the partner agency), as well.

#### Connectivity issues

If you are having connectivity issues when videoconferencing, try:

1. Adjusting video quality settings

1. Turning off video
1. Dialing in
1. Switching to a different tool

## Compliance with GSA policies

Our agency maintains a formal meeting, conference, and event policy which may be found [here](<https://www.gsa.gov/portal/mediaId/205471/fileName/OAS_57851_Conference_and_Event_Management_(Signed_on_January_28__2015).action>). The most applicable part of this policy for TTS is the approval requirement for internal meetings that _require the travel of more than six employees or will cost more than $10,000._ For these meetings, approval of both the Commissioner of the Technology Transformation Service and the Deputy Administrator of GSA via the [Salesforce Event Tracker](https://gsa.my.salesforce.com/a1b/o) system. For further information and help getting your request submitted, go to the [#training-conferences](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/messages/training-conferences) Slack channel.

## TTS townhalls

You'll hear well in advance about any upcoming townhalls, which should give you ample time to plan (and rearrange your schedule, if necessary). Conversations during townhall meetings take place in the Slack channel [#townhall](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/messages/townhall).
