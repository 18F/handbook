We’ve put together a curriculum of classes we encourage you to take during your [first 90 days](https://handbook.tts.gsa.gov/getting-started/).

These classes will expose you to a variety of aspects of our organization, introduce you to the people involved, and create opportunities to ask questions.

*Most of these classes are recommended, but optional* (with a few exceptions). If you have a conflicting team meeting or another commitment, prioritize that first! You can read the materials at your convenience or join the classes 2 weeks later.

*There is A LOT to take in over your first 1-3 months.* So take it all at your own pace, ask questions, and feel free to follow up with your class leads at any point — they’re happy to help.

## Curriculum

This section provides an overview of each of the classes, broken into topics, followed by a [a calendar of the first two weeks of classes]({{site.baseurl}}/onboarding-schedule/#calendar).

### Class Formats

Curricula like this can feel a bit overwhelming and exhausting, so we have varied the class format in order to best suit the content and your schedules. The formats include:
* *Video Conference* – (sometimes with a presentation) – TTS leads will talk you through the content and ask questions. _Sharing your video is highly encouraged but not required._
* *Self-guided Doc / Video* – You will be directed to a handbook page, a document, deck, or video to review on your own. _No quiz or test after – we swear._ We set up calendar invites for these, only as reminders — nothing more.
* *Slack* – Hosted in the #TTS-Classes slack channel at a scheduled time, a lead will post messages overviewing a topic and resources and make space for questions. _Emoji reactions are welcome._
* *Beta Coffee* – Similar to video conference but more conversational, including an overview of a topic and making space for discussion. A summary of the content shared is then also posted in the #TTS-Classes slack channel for posterity. _Sharing your video is highly encouraged but not required._

### Guidance to help you prioritize:

* *Required (and in bold)* - Critical for your onboarding and employment
* Recommended - Suggested for better understanding TTS
* As Needed – Additional and valuable context depending on your interests or office
