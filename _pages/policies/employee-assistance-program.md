title: Employee Assistance Program (EAP)
---

EAPs offer cost-free, **confidential** employee counseling, and referral to community treatment and/or professional service, as appropriate.

GSA's EAP, like those in most agencies, offers assistance for a variety of other situations – such as mental, emotional, family, legal and financial problems, AIDS and job stress – in addition to dealing with drug and alcohol problems. The EAP helps employees – and where feasible their families – with problems that may affect their well-being and their ability to do their jobs.

To contact GSA's Employee Assistance Helpline, call 1-800-222-0364 (1-888-262-7848 TTY). For more information, visit [Insite: EAP](https://insite.gsa.gov/portal/content/500305).

GSA’s EAP services are provided by Federal Occupational Health, U.S. Public Health Service. Supervisors and employees can find a wealth of helpful information on [their website](http://foh4you.com/).
