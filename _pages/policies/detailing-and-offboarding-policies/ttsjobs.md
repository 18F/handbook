## Announcements 

coming soon!


### External Process

The following explains the process for advertising roles that hiring managers would like to post internally (within TTS only). Types of roles include: Supervisor, Director, Detail opportunities.

Since these are hiring actions, they will mirror our [Merit Promotion](https://handbook.18f.gov/promotions/) process.  This means:
- There must be a vacant Position Number availale for your team (or PN that will soon become vacant - if this is replacing a current employee in the position being advertised)
- It must be prioritized by the Director of your office and the Front Office

Talent will assist and facilitate in the hiring process but in order to avoid conflicts of interest, the hiring action owner will be primarily responsible for developing job materials and interacting with applicants (employees).


### Submitting a request 

If this request is not on the current staffing plan or it is on the staffing plan, but the Hiring Manager (HM) would like it to be prioritized sooner, they must get approval from their organizations Director (ex: Angela Colter for 18F). If the Director agrees, then:
- The Director sends a request to [email](mailto:tts-talentteam@gsa.gov)
- Talent will send the request to the TTS Front Office 
- If Front Office approves, Talent will add the role to the Backlog of the Talent Acquisition Work-System Board

### Job Prep

Once the prioritized role is ready to be worked on, Talent will move the role to the Job Prep stage on the trello board and reach out to the HM to begin the process.
- The Talent PoC assigned to the role will supply the HM with the following templates:
  - [TTSJobs Application Form Template](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1_NYCLGtDANqs0EhgdjEbtNC7fUUJVQV35NTN6GMIkiM/edit?usp=sharing) for this need
    - HM should consider developing these documents prior to the role being selected so that the process will move quicker
  - [TTSJobs Announcement Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YIliZcF8dhqs4GzBAKYj5niqdgcN4tggTTDl3zeIOO8/edit?usp=sharing) for this need

In addition to the information within the templates, the Action Owner will need to provide:
- Interviewer names (resume reviewer if different than HM or interviewers)
- Custom Application Form questions

Once the TTSJobs Announcement is complete, Talent will:
- Add it to [#ttsjobs](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/messages/ttsjobs/) on Slack informing everyone of the new opportunity
- Add it to [TTSJobs Listings](#annoucements)

### Job Posted

When the job is posted, the role will move to the _Job Announcement_ stage on the trello board the HM dictates when and for how long they would like to post the role. Once the role comes down, Talent will save the resumes and applications in a folder that will be shared with the HM, interviewers and anyone else involved in the hiring decision.

While the applicants are being reviewed by the team, the role will sit in the _Qualification_ stage of the trello board.

### Qualification

The hiring team is responsible for confirming the applicants meet the qualifications outlined in the posting  (i.e. GS level, required experience).

For HR to move forward with a selection, the applicant must meet the following qualification: 

- must hold the same grade level as the PD or have at least one year of specialized experience at the next grade below 
  - if applicant is at the grade below, they will need to provide an updated resume and HR will need to qualify them. **This means Supervisors should NOT announce who they have selected until HR approves the selection**
- If the role being advertised is a detail and does not have a PD associated with it, then any GS level can apply, unless the HM specifies which GS levels they are accepting.


### Interview

Once the team has decided who they would like to move forward with, they will send the list of applicants to their Talent PoC for interview scheduling.

### Selection

When the team has determined who they would like to place in the role, they must:
- First confirm with the employee’s supervisor that they are OK with this employee moving to their team 
- Forward the supervisor's approval to Talent. Talent will need to submit a Reassignment PAR to HR.

It is the responsibility of the HM provide applications with the applicable feedback, whether that is letting the applicant know they are moving forward in the process, that they have been selected or that they have been rejected (including providing feedback why if applicable). Talent will not notify nor offer feedback to applicants.

**If you are advertising a detail:** the action can only be submitted for a time period of no more than 120 days. The detail can then be extended for another 120 days If the HM and the employee’s supervisor agree to extend.
