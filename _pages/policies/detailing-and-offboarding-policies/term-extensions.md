title: Term extensions
---

Many TTS employees are hired on term appointments (under the Schedule A direct hiring authority), which sets a limit of 2 years for the initial period of employment with the option to renew for up to 2 additional years for a maximum term of 4 years.

## Process

1. On a quarterly basis, Talent will reach out to the Director of each office with a list of staff whose 2-year terms are about to end. 

2. Directors will need to provide the following info to Talent:

    * How long will the employee's term be renewed for? (6 months, 1 year, or 2 years)
    * Justification (type of work employee does, how billable they are, are they currently on a project, and will they remain billable? if not billable, what work are they doing and why is it necessary?)
  
3. Talent will send the list of renewal requests to TTS Front Office for approval.

4. If the **decision is to extend**, Talent will process a Personnel Action Request (PAR) to extend their term. Employment status and benefits will remain the same and no additional action is needed from the employee or their supervisor.

    At this point, the extension process is completed by the Talent Team and GSA HR.

    If the **decision is not to extend**, the Talent Team will process a PAR to end your term at the end of the initial 2 years. See [Leaving TTS]({{site.baseurl}}/leaving-tts/) for more details.

5. Employees should reach out to their supervisor for the status of these requests.

    *GSA and internal systems do not process extensions ahead of time, so you won't see an updated NTE date in HR Links until after your first term concludes.*

6. After the end of your first term, the Talent Team checks to make sure that the extension has been processed. You should **also** check your HR Links account on the renewal date to confirm that your NTE date is accurate.
    
    Your updated NTE (Not To Exceed date) will show up in your HR Links account on the day **after** your current NTE date (expiration date) along with your updated SF50 under the “Personnel Actions (SF-50s)” tab.  

    New term beginning dates are the following day from the previous term end date, excluding weekends. If your term ended on a weekend, the new term will begin the following Monday. New term end dates will be the Friday if it falls on a weekend. So, if your current NTE date is 6/15/17, you would be able to view your new NTE date of 6/15/19 starting on 6/16/17.

    **If your NTE date was not updated, contact the Talent Team immediately.**

## What happens between the decision and the end of term?

- Approved extensions are added to Talent's internal Operations Trello board.
- Talent sends extension PARs (PARs are submitted and processed through HR Links) in batches at the beginning of each month for all extensions happening the following month.
- HR reviews and confirms the PAR, checking that all information is accurate (employee has another term left, correct extension dates, etc.). HR is not "approving" the extension request at this step of the process. The extension has already been approved; this is just a matter of processing.
- HR sends the approved PAR to CPC (Consolidated Processing Center in Kansas City, MO) to have it processed.
- CPC processes the PAR. They process all approved personnel actions in GSA systems and complete the SF50, which is attached to your personnel record and can be viewed in HR Links. They process PARs based on action date, which is why you will not see the updates in HR Links or our internal systems until the extension date.

## Things to note

If you don’t know when your term ends, you can find your Not To Exceed (NTE) date by looking in [HR Links](https://corporateapps.gsa.gov/hr-links/). Click on the navigator icon, choose `Navigator`, then `Workforce Administration`, then `Job Information`, then `Employee Request USF`.

Considerations for renewal include organizational priorities, position needs, and your individual performance to date.
