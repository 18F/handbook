title: Term extensions

This guide covers how to extend your time at TTS after two years.

## Background

Most employees at TTS are hired on term appointments under the Schedule A direct hiring authority, which sets a limit of two years for the initial period of employment with the option to renew for up to two additional years for a maximum term of four years.

## Process

1) On a quarterly basis, Talent will reach out to the Director of each office with a list of staff whose 2-yr terms are about to end. 

2) Directors will need to provide the following info to Talent:
    - How long will the employee's term be renewed for (6 months, 1 yr, 2 yr, etc)
    - Justification (type of work employee does, how billable they are, currently on a project and will remain billable? if not billable - why is this OK)
  
3) Talent will send the list of renewal requests to TTS Front Office for approval.

4) If the **decision is to extend**, Talent will process a Personnel Action Request (PAR) to extend your term. Your employment status and benefits will remain the same and no additional action is needed from you or your supervisor.
    - At this point, the extension process is completed by the Talent Team and GSA HR.

  If the **decision is not to extend**, the Talent Team will process a PAR to end your term at the end of the initial two years. See [Leaving TTS]({{site.baseurl}}/leaving-tts/) for more details.

5) Employees should reach out to their supervisor for the status of these requests.

## Things to note

- If you don’t know when your term ends, you can look in [HR Links](https://corporateapps.gsa.gov/hr-links/) by going to the NavBar and selecting the Favorites Icon - HR Links profile
- Considerations for renewal include organizational priorities, position needs, and your individual performance to date.
- Approved extensions are added to Talent's internal Operations Trello board.
- Talent sends the extension PARs (PARs are submitted and processed through HR Links) in batches at the beginning of each month for all extensions happening the following month.
- HR reviews and confirms the PAR checking that all information is accurate (employee has another term left, correct extension dates, etc.).  
  - HR is not "approving" the extension request at this step of the process.  Your extension has already been approved; this is just a matter of processing.
  - *Note: New Term beginning dates are the following day from the previous term end date excluding weekends. If it’s a weekend it will be the following Monday. New Term end dates will be the Friday if it falls on a weekend.*
- HR sends the approved PAR to CPC (Consolidated Processing Center in Kansas City, MO) to have it processed.
- CPC processes the PAR. They process all approved personnel actions in GSA systems and complete the SF50, which is attached to your personnel record and can be viewed in HR Links. They process PARs based on action date, which is why you will not see the updates in HR Links or our internal systems until the extension date.

*Please note that GSA and internal systems do not process extensions ahead of time.*

5) Your updated NTE (Not To Exceed date) will show up in your HR Links account on the day **after** your current NTE date (expiration date) along with your updated SF50 under the “Personnel Actions (SF-50s)” tab.  So if your current NTE date is 6/15/17, you would see the new NTE date of 6/15/19 on the following day 6/16/17.  
- Your NTE date is found by clicking on the HR Links profile tab, which can be found by scrolling to the NavBar icon and selecting "Favorites" .

*The Talent Team checks to make sure that the extension has been processed, but you should also check your HR Links account on the renewal date to confirm that your NTE date is accurate.* ***If the date was not updated, contact the Talent Team immediately.***
