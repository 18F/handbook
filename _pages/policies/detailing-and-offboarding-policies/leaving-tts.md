This guide covers the offboarding policy and process.

## How to resign

### 1. Email your resignation letter

If you decide you want to leave TTS, send an official email to your supervisor and [leavingTTS@gsa.gov](mailto:leavingTTS@gsa.gov).

Include your termination date, which should be at least two weeks out. Your last day at TTS cannot be a federal holiday.

### 2. Complete the clearance checklist

Keith Wilson from the TTS Talent Team ([#talent](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/messages/talent/)) will set time with you to complete the [employee clearance checklist](https://drive.google.com/a/gsa.gov/file/d/0B2b-_CCBBYvRNGNVWTRjUnpmTVNtUUR6clVJdUt2MFVTNm5j/view?usp=sharing).

### 3. Review benefits paperwork

Review your [benefits options](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fuPxdhSY4YCYQvTFhjmjtLpRK8_ophZnFA9hsK8zftA/edit).

You should also review the [FERS refund information](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TiFdQ-2pyrmib3Zsh1GDGeWorM7F-cbxk1u-82zX0Aw/edit) and [Form SF 3106](https://drive.google.com/a/gsa.gov/file/d/0B4J4Dpr2HVDsMnpEQnc1ZHI0RkVadjVOZGZhOTVKMVZyUktN/view) before your last day.

If you have any questions, please contact [cpc.benefits-retirement@gsa.gov](mailto:cpc.benefits-retirement@gsa.gov).

### 4. Return your equipment

When you leave TTS, you are responsible for returning all TTS issued equipment. Failure to do so may lead to your final paycheck being withheld until the equipment is returned.

## Offboarding process

A member of the Talent Team will `Duplicate` the `Template` in the [Off-Boarding Tasks doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IlFY5AAvTyuS7yDHk5_odJGHYZDU_MN9HNGKJ2zXwi0/edit#gid=0) to make a new checklist once leavingTTS@gsa.gov has been notified that a team member is leaving.  If the checklist hasn't been created, please email [leavingTTS@gsa.gov](mailto:leavingTTS@gsa.gov) or ping #talent for help.  More detail for certain tasks is below. Note that, per GSA policy, the "technical offboardings" (access to any work system) need to happen within 24 hours of the person ending their work at GSA.

### Supervisor

- Work with the employee to transition the employee's workload to other team members.
- Ensure they complete their last timesheet in Tock.

### Talent Team

- Provide [TTS Exit Interview Questionnaire](https://goo.gl/forms/jBmNLwg8Y4ZY4n4s1) to offboarding employee.
  - For offboarding interns, use [this survey](https://goo.gl/forms/XOy7QO4zcnz6LyLh1).
- Conduct an exit interview based on the responses to the questionnaire.
  - Documentation will be kept anonymous, but content may be used in aggregate to highlight trends.
- Complete the [clearance checklist](https://drive.google.com/a/gsa.gov/file/d/0B2b-_CCBBYvRNGNVWTRjUnpmTVNtUUR6clVJdUt2MFVTNm5j/view?usp=sharing) with the employee.

## Exiting gracefully

### Goodbye email

You are under no obligation to send out a farewell email, but if you do, please use bcc: for any distribution lists you're sending it to.  This allows people to respond to you directly without creating additional email noise for coworkers.

### Slack

As you leave, you’re encouraged to join the [#alumni](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/messages/C0DH5B68Y) channel on Slack.

### Writing a post on your personal blog

If you want to write a post on your personal blog about your experiences in government or why you’re leaving, we recommend that you wait until you are no longer on staff before you hit “Publish.” This helps to avoid any issues with Hatch Act compliance and with inadvertently writing or speaking on behalf of GSA without permission.
