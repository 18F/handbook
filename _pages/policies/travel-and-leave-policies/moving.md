If you're moving to a different GSA region, please reference the "Process update" section below.  If you're moving within the same GSA region, please follow the steps in the "Change your address" section below.  

## Relocating as a Virtual Employee

Virtual employees who are moving (and staying virtual) and employees who work out of a physical office (DC, SF, NYC, Chicago) but will be moving and becoming a virtual employee require an approved Virtual Work Agreement. 

## How to fill out a Virtual Work Agreement

Here are step-by-step [instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JCDZbABzjPWD7QPqA2tBnmvK1rs4QNFu_AUvTgjwqu4/edit) for completing the VWA Form.  Please see below for a comprehensive list of when a VWA is required and for tips on filling it out.  
### When a Virtual Work Agreement is needed

* For new hires that will work from a virtual duty station, i.e. not working from one of our offices (DC, CHI, NYC or SFO) 
* If your virtual duty station is changing (even if the move is just down the street)
* It is not required if you are moving to one of our offices (DC, CHI, NYC or SFO)
* If the number of approved trips on your original VWA is increasing
* If your position changes due to a reassignment, PD change or a promotion
* If you are moving to a 100% Telework schedule

### Things to note when completing the VWA
* Supervisors will need to provide a justification for all VWAs whether they provide a cost savings or cost increase 
* In the justification include the salaries for the staff member’s current location and the new location. In the Form the new duty station must always be compared to the **DC office** but TTS leadership would like to see the difference between the actual current location and the new location.
* Supervisors will need to provide the number of trips an employee will have to make to DC annually and how long those trips will be (do not include billable trips).
* Existing staff VWAs can just have the city and state listed (noting on the form that the person is asking for approval prior to moving so they do not have a new full address yet)

### TTS approval signatures required for VWA

* Immediate Supervisor 
  * In Part F, enter name (box 1), title (box 2), and get signature (box 3) 
* Your Office’s Assistant Commissioner (Alla, Ben, Rebecca, Sarah, Dom or Bob)
  * Enter in Part G, enter name (box 1a), title (box 1b), and get signature (box 1c)
* Send form to TTS-Talent-team@gsa.gov who will be responsible for obtaining the remaining approvals and routing through the GSA process
  *  *Please note - it can take up to 5 days to get all of these signatures*

## Process update

The official GSA process for moving regions has recently changed, and we are currently drafting updated guidance.  In the meantime, if you need to move, please reach out to the Talent Team via [Slack](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/messages/talent) or [email](mailto:tts-talentteam@gsa.gov).      

*Please note that full approval can take a significant period of time and is not guaranteed, so we highly recommend that you don't finalize plans to move until receiving full approval.* 

The information below should only be used for reference and may not reflect the updated GSA policy:

## Effective date

Your effective date should be the start of a pay period. Pay period dates can be found on [GSA InSite](http://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/102507).

A member of the TTS Talent Team will complete a report of personnel action (RPA) and a virtual worker agreement (VWA) which is used if you're not going to work out of a federal office along with a VWA Appendix 2. The paperwork is submitted to OHRM and then they process everything. You will only need to sign the Appendix 2.

## Changes in pay

If you’re changing regions, your pay will change. Look up your new pay [here](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/salaries-wages/). Find your region under the pay table for the current year, and then find your step and grade. That's what you'll be paid in your new location.

## Change your address

1. Change your home address on [Employee Express](https://www.employeeexpress.gov/) to notify most GSA operations of your new address.

2. Once your move is effective in GSA systems (SF50/CHRIS), change your state tax withholding by contacting the payroll office at <mailto:KC-Payroll.Finance@gsa.gov>.

3. To notify the Thrift Savings Program (TSP) of your new address, email it to both the Consolidated Processing Center at <mailto:cpc.personnel@gsa.gov> and to the payroll office at <mailto:KC-Payroll.Finance@gsa.gov>. Payroll will notify the TSP office of your new address.

4. Contact your health insurance, dental insurance, and any other insurances you may have and let them know about your address change. You will also need to verify that your insurance will be valid in your new location or you will need to change it. Contact GSA HR at [cpc.benefits-retirement@gsa.gov](mailto:cpc.benefits-retirement@gsa.gov) if you have any questions.  

## Change your Slack location

We've started putting our location in parentheses after our names in Slack to make it easier for coworkers to tell where we are. To update it, [open your profile](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/account/profile), click **Edit**, and update the letters after your last name.
