If you cannot use one of these flights, you must justify why you are choosing a non-contract carrier and fare.

If the fare that you choose is nonrefundable, or exceeds the [City Pair rate](http://cpsearch.fas.gsa.gov/cpsearch/search.do?method=enter) (note that lookup values here are for one-way fares), you will need an additional email of approval from your client (billable) or director (non-billable) sent to tts-travelauths@gsa.gov.

### Book lodging

[Fedrooms](https://www.fedrooms.com) is the preferred way to book accommodations while traveling on official business. All rooms are ["fire-safe"](http://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/102177), under the government maximum rate, and fully refundable up to 24 hours before check-in, which minimizes both overall cost and risk to the government.

When booking hotels for official travel, always use your travel card, whether you are using Fedrooms, Concur, or any other service.

#### Can I book outside of Fedrooms?

You may book outside of Fedrooms if you can find alternative accommodations that are "fire-safe" and have a similar refund policy as Fedrooms, if the overall cost is lower or the location is closer to the work site.

While some services (such as Airbnb, hotels.com, etc.) offer lower prices, they do come with a risk to the government-- if your trip is cancelled, some or all of that total may not be refunded. Since our clients may not agree to pick up that tab, nonrefundable fees sometimes eat into TTS’s operating budget.

If you need to book a hotel outside of fedrooms.com, please check if booking comes with any nonrefundable fees. If it does, please get your client or your supervisor to approve the approximate amount of what is nonrefundable and send the email to tts-travelauths@gsa.gov. Nonrefundable hotel fees that are not pre-approved are the traveler’s liability.

Choosing **"I will book a hotel now"** is another option available to you, which is sometimes, but not always similar to Fedrooms. Choosing this option will allow you to book a hotel in Concur is to book directly in Concur. Before doing so, please ensure that [your travel card is saved in your Concur profile]({{site.baseurl}}/first-time-travel-complete-concur-profile). Then, you can go ahead and follow some more detailed instructions [here]({{site.baseurl}}/how-to-book-a-hotel-in-concur).

When you are finished booking your hotel, [proceed on to submitting for Concur approval]({{site.baseurl}}/travel-guide-3-approval).
