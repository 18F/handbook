## Brief overview of booking travel

If you have been [set up in Concur](/first-time-travel-get-in-concur), received your [GSA travel card](/first-time-travel-travel-card), [saved your travel card information to your Concur profile](/first-time-travel-complete-concur-profile), and have started the process of [securing approval from your authorizing official](/travel-guide-faq/#how-to-secure-authorizing-official-approval) (you may also book first to get the most accurate estimate of costs for either the [email of approval](/travel-guide-faq/#how-to-secure-authorizing-official-approval) or [event request when applicable](/travel-guide-faq/#How-can-I-get-my-travel-approved-to-attend-a-training-conference-speaking-event-or-other-IRL-or-large-team-gathering)), head into **[Concur](travel.gsa.gov)**, where you can book:

* [Flights or Amtrak](/travel-guide-faq/#how-to-book-flights-or-rail), paid directly by GSA
* [Hotels](travel-guide-faq/#book-lodging), charged to your GSA travel card
* [Rental cars](travel-guide-faq/#booking-a-rental-car) (if approved), charged to your GSA travel card

Any reservations made in Concur will be held until approvals are secured and finalized-- nothing is charged to you, your travel card, or GSA.

**Note:** _If you don't have your GSA travel card yet OR your estimated departure is less than 72 hours away, call AdTrav at (877) 472-6716 to make your reservations, then [head into Concur an hour later](travel.gsa.gov)._ **Make sure you continue to follow the steps below, or your travel will not be ticketed!**

*If you don't yet have a travel card and book through AdTrav, hotels will be charged against a personal credit or debit card, but flights or rail will be charged directly to the GSA.*

## Brief overview of finalizing approvals

Once you have finalized your reservations, there are still a few more steps to follow through on.

* [Completing trip information](/travel-guide-faq/#how-to-complete-your-trip-information), including relevant details about your trip.
* [Justify any rental car use or personal vehicle mileage claims](/travel-guide-faq/#How-to-Justify-Rental-Cars-and-Personal-Vehicle-Mileage), when applicable.
* [Stamp and submit authorization](/travel-guide-faq/#how-to-stamp-and-submit-for-travel-team-approval), ensuring your authorization is in SUBMIT TO APPROVER status.
* If you haven't done so already, [secure written approval from your authorizing official](/travel-guide-faq/#how-to-secure-authorizing-official-approval) and send it to tts-travelauths@gsa.gov so the TTS travel team can likewise approve your trip in the system.

Ensure all of the above steps are completed no later than 3:30 PM ET the last business day before travel to give the travel team sufficient time to review. After-hours or emergency travel requests may be made in coordination with your supervisor and AdTrav via the process outlined [here](/travel-guide-B-after-hours-emergency-travel-authorizations).<br>

Should you need to rebook your travel at any point in the process, read the instructions [here](/travel-guide-A-amended-authorizations).
