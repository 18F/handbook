## Brief overview of booking travel

If you have been [set up in Concur](/first-time-travel-get-in-concur) and have received your [GSA travel card](/first-time-travel-travel-card), [saved your travel card information to your Concur profile](/first-time-travel-complete-concur-profile), and have started the process of [securing approval from your authorizing official](/travel-guide-faq/#how-to-secure-authorizing-official-approval), head into [Concur](travel.gsa.gov), where you can book: 

* [Flights or Amtrak](/travel-guide-faq/#how-to-book-flights-or-rail), paid directly by GSA
* [Hotels](travel-guide-faq/#book-lodging), charged to your GSA travel card
* [Rental cars](travel-guide-faq/#booking-a-rental-car) (if approved), charged to your GSA travel card

Any reservations made in Concur will be held until approvals are finalized-- nothing is charged to you, your travel card, or GSA until all approvals are secured and finalized.

**Note:** _If you don't have your GSA travel card yet OR your estimated departure is less than 72 hours away, call AdTrav at (877) 472-6716 to make your reservations, then [head into Concur an hour later](travel.gsa.gov)._ **Make sure you continue to follow the steps below, or your travel will not be ticketed!**

*If you don't yet have a travel card and book through AdTrav, hotels will be charged against a personal credit or debit card, but flights or rail will be charged directly to the GSA.*

## Brief overview of finalizing approvals

Once you have finalized your reservations, there are still a few more steps to follow through on.

* [Completing trip information](/travel-guide-faq/#how-to-complete-your-trip-information), including relevant details about your trip.
* [Stamp and submit authorization](/travel-guide-faq/#how-to-stamp-and-submit-for-travel-team-approval), ensuring your authorization is in SUBMIT TO APPROVER status.
* If you haven't done so already, [secure written approval from your authorizing official](/travel-guide-faq/#how-to-secure-authorizing-official-approval)
   * If traveling to a training, conference, speaking event, or other "IRL" or large team gathering*, or internationally for any reason, this approval is secured automatically through the [event request process](https://handbook.18f.gov/attending-conferences/), though an email of approval is still required if you will be [extending your trip at your own expense](/travel-guide-faq/#what-if-I-am-extending-travel-for-personal-reasons), [flying to or from points that are not either your duty station or location of the event](/travel-guide-faq/#What-if-I-am-traveling-to-or-returning-from-a-location-other-than-my-home-location), or combining your event travel with travel for some other reason.
   * If traveling for business reasons or small team gatherings, you or someone in your group must secure [a sufficiently descriptive email of approval from your authorizing official](/travel-guide-faq/#how-to-secure-authorizing-official-approval) and send it to tts-travelauths@gsa.gov, so the TTS travel team can approve your travel in the system. 
   * To expedite your approval, you should take care of this step before booking your travel. Ensure all of the above steps are completed no later than 3:30 PM ET the last business day before travel to give the travel team sufficient time to review. After-hours or emergency travel requests may be made in coordination with your supervisor and AdTrav via the process outlined [here](/travel-guide-B-after-hours-emergency-travel-authorizations).
   
Should you need to rebook your travel at any point in the process, read the instructions [here](/travel-guide-A-amended-authorizations).
   
*The threshold for a large team gathering is over 6 employees traveling for an internal management meeting (not day-to-day business) and/or more than $10,000 in estimated travel expenses for the group. Requests for approval of these events is typically handled by the organizer of the meeting.
