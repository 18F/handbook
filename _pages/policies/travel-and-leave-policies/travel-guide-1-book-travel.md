## Brief overview of booking travel

If you have been [set up in Concur](/first-time-travel-get-in-concur) and have received your [GSA travel card](/first-time-travel-travel-card), you may go ahead and book [flights, Amtrak](/#how-to-book-flights-or-rail), [hotels](/#book-lodging), and [rental cars](/#booking-a-rental-car) (if approved) in [Concur](travel.gsa.gov)*.

***Note** If you've applied for your travel card but haven't received it yet OR your estimated departure is less than 72 hours away, **Call AdTrav at (877) 472-6716 to make your reservations!**

*If you don't yet have a travel card, hotels will be charged against a personal credit or debit card, but flights or rail will be charged directly to the GSA.*

***Also, You'll still need to take action in Concur** about an hour after your call with AdTrav. Skip ahead and read on [here](/#completing-trip-information) for directions on what you will need to do in Concur. [Secure your authorizing official's approval](/secure-approvals/#secure-authorizing-officials-approval) if you haven't done so already.*

## How to Book Flights or Rail

#### Enter your Destination, then Origin

1. Go to Concur at [travel.gsa.gov](http://travel.gsa.gov)

2. In the shortcuts menu on the upper left hand corner, select **Travel - New Booking**

3. Click on the **Air/Rail** icon (this should be already selected). If you need to travel by train only, choose the **Rail** icon instead.

***Note:** If you need to travel by both air and rail, call AdTrav at (877) 472-6716 and they will make your reservations for you. An hour after your call, skip ahead to [this step](/#completing-trip-information) to submit your AdTrav reservation for approval.

4. Type in the name of your destination city in *Temporary Duty Location* search field, and click on the search icon. You must search by city, not address. Select the correct location from the drop-down.

***Note:** The destination city is entered before the departure city

6. When selecting your location it will auto-populate ‘TDY Per Diem Location’. This is the Per Diem allowance amount for that location.

7. Choose your departure city and airport

8. Click **Search** to move onto the next screen.

#### How to Choose a Flight

When choosing flights, you may notice they fall into four different categories:

<img src="/images/travel/5-view-select-flights.png" class="travel-guide-hide" alt="Concur flight selection screen">

* **Govt. Contract Discounted:** the preferred option. In general, these fares are only available 15 or more days in advance, so try to book your travel as early as possible.

* **Govt. Contract:** the standard option, based on the [city pair rate](https://cpsearch.fas.gsa.gov/cpsearch/search.do?method=enter), the agreed upon rate for government flights between two cities. These are preferred if no govt. contract discounted fares are available.

* **Non-contract Government:** these fares are also acceptable to book if the timing is more advantageous. All these fares are within the City Pair rate and are fully refundable. No additional approvals are required to book a non-contract government fare.

* **Lowest published:** while these fares may come at a lower cost than the contract options, they also come at increased risk to the government because many of these fares are nonrefundable. Any flight that is nonrefundable must be explicitly approved by the authorizing official before the TTS travel team can approve. If you think that choosing a "Lowest published" nonrefundable fare is your best option, skip ahead to [securing your approval email now](/travel-guide-2-secure-approvals), and then come back to book later. You'll want to ensure you secure the approval before you book because these fares expire quickly, often before authorizing official and travel team approval can be reasonably obtained.

***Note about flights with policy violations:**

If you need to take a flight which indicates a policy violation, the type of violation will inform what steps you need to take next. Click on "View Fares" to pull up additional details about your flight selection.

If any part of the fare that you chose is nonrefundable, or exceeds the [City Pair rate](http://cpsearch.fas.gsa.gov/cpsearch/search.do?method=enter) (note that lookup values here are for one-way fares), you will need an additional email approving the risk of nonrefundable airfare and/or additional costs from [your authorizing official](/travel-guide-2-secure-approvals/#who-is-my-authorizing-official-and-what-is-my-budget) sent to tts-travelauths@gsa.gov.

[What justifies using a non-contract fare?](https://www.gsa.gov/policy-regulations/regulations/federal-travel-regulation-ftr?asset=107365#i1204997)

1. Select **View Fares** to view additional itinerary details
<img src="/images/travel/6-view-fares.png" class="travel-guide-hide" alt="viewing fares">

2. Select the lowest cost, most compliant fare available by clicking on the blue button at right with the price. This will take you onto the confirmation page.

<img src="/images/travel/7-flight-details.png" class="travel-guide-hide" alt="selecting a flight">

3. **Review and Reserve Flight:** Review your flight itinerary, passenger information, frequent flyer information.
<img src="/images/travel/8-passenger-info.png" class="travel-guide-hide" alt="reviewing the flight">

<img src="/images/travel/8a-reserve-flight.png" class="travel-guide-hide" alt="reserving the flight">

5. This will take you to the **Trip Overview**. This page also lists your current reservations. 

***Note:** the deadline on the confirmation page. Ensure that you have approval from the TTS Travel Team before this date. Your tickets are booked, but are not purchased until one of them approves.

## Book lodging

By choosing **"I will book a hotel now."** you will be allowed to book your hotel directly in Concur. Before doing so, please ensure that [your travel card is saved in your Concur profile](/first-time-travel-complete-concur-profile).

***Note**: If you don't have a travel card yet, make sure that you've [applied for one](/first-time-travel-travel-card) (it is required by GSA policy), then choose "I will book a hotel later". Call AdTrav at (877) 472-6716 to reserve your hotel (and rental car if needed) on your personal card in the meantime. Assuming you've already booked your flight or train in Concur, **mention the authorization number associated with your itinerary** so you don't get a second overlapping authorization for your hotel and/or rental car. You can verify your authorization number by going to the "Authorizations" tab in Concur and finding the number in blue on the left side associated with your travel dates. An hour after you call with AdTrav, proceed on to [completing trip information](/#completing-trip-information).

#### How to Book a hotel in Concur

1. When you click on the **Next** button after confirming your flights, a popup will appear asking if you'd like to book a hotel now. Select **I will book a hotel now** and click **OK**.
<img src="/images/travel/11-book-hotel-now.png" class="travel-guide-hide" alt="selecting hotel booking option">

***Note:** if you are coming back to this step after going back to the main menu of Concur, make sure your saved authorization is selected, go to **Travel Home**, reopen your itinerary, and then choose "Hotel" under "Add to your Itinerary".

2. Enter check-in and check-out dates, location, any preferred hotels, and then click next.

3. Confirm the per diem location and click next. The maximum lodging rate and M&IE allowance is indicated below.

4. Choose a hotel from the list of search results. Unless you have approval otherwise, or intend to pay for the difference in price personally, sure that you pick a hotel with a nightly rate **equal to or less than the government maximum for the area listed [here](https://www.gsa.gov/travel/plan-book/per-diem-rates/per-diem-rates-lookup).** In the side bar you can filter your search results to only those under the Per diem rate by checking **Hide hotels over Per Diem limit ($XXX.00)**.

5. Click on  **View Rooms**, to view a detailed list of rooms within the hotel and select the room by clicking on the listed price at right.

6. **Review and Reserve Hotel** On the review screen:
    * Select your hotel room preferences
    * Choose a credit card
    * Agree to the hotel's rate policies.
    * Click on **Reserve Hotel and Continue**

7. You will now be taken back to your trip itinerary. Note that the hotel has been added to the flight.

8. Scroll down and click **Next** and [securing approvals](/travel-guide-2-securing approvals), or if needed, continue on to [reserve a rental car](/#booking-a-rental-car).

#### Can I book outside of Concur?

Unless there are extenuating circumstances, you should use Concur for all reservations (flights, hotels, and rental cars). If you choose to book a hotel outside of Concur, include a justification that corresponds with one of the following (from the Federal Travel Regulation):

1. When you are attending a conference where the conference sponsor has negotiated with one or more lodging facilities to set aside a specific number of rooms for conference attendees and to ensure that a set aside room is available to you, you are required to book lodging directly with the lodging facility.

2. When your travel is to a remote location and it is not possible to book lodging accommodations through the TMS or ETS (Concur).

3. When such travel arrangements are so complex and circumstance will not allow you to book your travel through an online self-service booking tool (Concur).

If you need to book a hotel outside of Concur, check if booking comes with any nonrefundable fees. If it does, make sure that you get your authorizing official to approve the approximate amount of what is nonrefundable and send the email to tts-travelauths@gsa.gov. **Nonrefundable hotel fees that are not pre-approved are the traveler’s liability.** Should booking a hotel in Concur or via AdTrav not be possible, [Fedrooms](fedrooms.com) offers hotels within government maximum rates that have flexible cancellation policies.

When you are finished booking your hotel, proceed on to [complete trip information]((/#completing-trip-information)).

## Booking a Rental Car

**Before booking a rental car** ensure that manager or client who approved your travel explicitly approved budget for a rental car-- in certain situations, rental cars and parking charges are not as advantageous to the government as common carriers such as taxis and/or public transit. Government vehicles may also be available-- check out the guide [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19D9YBPELZav3Y-gNUxEVS4wBbV89iUTUeirH46rE378/edit) for more details.

### How to Book A Rental Car in Concur

1. From the itinerary page, choose "Car" under "Add to your Itinerary" and then select the trip leg when prompted.

2. Indicate pick-up and drop-off dates, location(s), car type, and preferred vendor(s).

***Note** GSA employees are required to use the lowest cost compact car unless approved for a larger vehicle based on meeting one or more of the justifications listed in [FTR §301-10.450(c)](https://www.gsa.gov/policy-regulations/regulations/federal-travel-regulation-ftr?asset=107365#i1205588).

3. Confirm your email address and travel card information, and then **Reserve Car and Continue.**

**Important notes:**

Be aware that the rental company you select must participate in the [Defense Travel Management Office's (DTMO) Rental Car Program](https://www.defensetravel.dod.mil/site/rentalCar.cfm). Rental car companies participating in the program established ceiling rates; unlimited mileage (except for one-way rentals); vehicle contract will be ready upon arrival; if size/class reserved is not available, the company will offer an upgrade at the same cost; no underage drivers’ fee for drivers between the ages of 18-25; no minimum rental period; no cost for additional drivers; and full coverage insurance for damages resulting from an accident while performing official travel.

The Government is self-insured and rental vehicles under the DTMO agreement include full coverage for damages resulting from
an accident while performing official travel. Employees on TDY travel within CONUS will not be reimbursed for collision damage waiver (CDW) or theft insurance available on commercial rental contracts. Employees will be reimbursed for collision damage waiver or theft insurance while on TDY in non-foreign areas in accordance with [FTR §301-10.451](https://www.gsa.gov/policy-regulations/regulations/federal-travel-regulation-ftr?asset=107365#d25e5538). Personal liability insurance is considered a personal expense and will not be reimbursed.

Once you have reserved your rental car, continue on to [complete trip information](/#completing-trip-information).

## Completing Trip Information

On the **Trip Booking Information** page you must enter some general information in order to ensure that your trip gets billed to the right client and/or budget.
