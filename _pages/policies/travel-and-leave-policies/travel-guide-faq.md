## Questions about booking travel

### How to Book Flights or Rail

#### Enter your Destination, then Origin

1. Go to Concur at [travel.gsa.gov](https://travel.gsa.gov)

2. In the shortcuts menu on the upper left hand corner, select **Travel - New Booking**

3. Click on the **Air/Rail** icon (this should be already selected). If you need to travel by train only, choose the **Rail** icon instead.

***Note:** If you need to travel by both air and rail, call AdTrav at (877) 472-6716 and they will make your reservations for you. An hour after your call, skip ahead to [this step](#completing-trip-information) to submit your AdTrav reservation for approval.

4. Type in the name of your destination city in *Temporary Duty Location* search field, and click on the search icon. You must search by city, not address. Select the correct location from the drop-down.
<img src="/images/travel/2-choose-departure.png" class="travel-guide-hide" alt="choosing destination city">

***Note:** The destination city is entered before the departure city

6. When selecting your location it will auto-populate ‘TDY Per Diem Location’. This is the Per Diem allowance amount for that location.
<img src="/images/travel/3-autofil-per-diem.png" class="travel-guide-hide" alt="auto-fill of Per Diem Location">

7. Choose your departure city and airport
<img src="/images/travel/4-choose-origin-city.png" class="travel-guide-hide" alt="choosing origin city">

8. Click **Search** to move onto the next screen.

#### How to Choose a Flight

When choosing flights, you may notice they fall into four different categories:

<img src="/images/travel/5-view-select-flights.png" class="travel-guide-hide" alt="Concur flight selection screen">

* **Govt. Contract Discounted:** the preferred option. In general, these fares are only available 15 or more days in advance, so try to book your travel as early as possible.

* **Govt. Contract:** the standard option, based on the [city pair rate](https://cpsearch.fas.gsa.gov/cpsearch/search.do?method=enter), the agreed upon rate for government flights between two cities. These are preferred if no govt. contract discounted fares are available.

* **Non-contract Government:** these fares are also acceptable to book if the timing is more advantageous. All these fares are within the City Pair rate and are fully refundable. No additional approvals are required to book a non-contract government fare.

* **Lowest published:** while these fares may come at a lower cost than the contract options, they also come at increased risk to the government because many of these fares are nonrefundable. Any flight that is nonrefundable must be explicitly approved by the authorizing official before the TTS travel team can approve. If you think that choosing a "Lowest published" nonrefundable fare is your best option, skip ahead to [securing your approval email now](#how-to-secure-authorizing-official-approval), and then come back to book later. You'll want to ensure you secure the approval before you book because these fares expire quickly, often before authorizing official and travel team approval can be reasonably obtained.

***Note about flights with policy violations:**

If you need to take a flight which indicates a policy violation, the type of violation will inform what steps you need to take next. Click on "View Fares" to pull up additional details about your flight selection.

If any part of the fare that you chose is nonrefundable, or exceeds the [City Pair rate](http://cpsearch.fas.gsa.gov/cpsearch/search.do?method=enter) (note that lookup values here are for one-way fares), you will need an additional email approving the risk of nonrefundable airfare and/or additional costs from [your authorizing official](#who-is-my-authorizing-official-and-what-is-my-budget) sent to tts-travelauths@gsa.gov.

[What justifies using a non-contract fare?](https://www.gsa.gov/policy-regulations/regulations/federal-travel-regulation-ftr?asset=107365#i1204997)

1. Select **View Fares** to view additional itinerary details
<img src="/images/travel/6-view-fares.png" class="travel-guide-hide" alt="viewing fares">

2. Select the lowest cost, most compliant fare available by clicking on the blue button at right with the price. This will take you onto the confirmation page.

<img src="/images/travel/7-flight-details.png" class="travel-guide-hide" alt="selecting a flight">

3. **Review and Reserve Flight:** Review your flight itinerary, passenger information, frequent flyer information.
<img src="/images/travel/8-passenger-info.png" class="travel-guide-hide" alt="reviewing the flight">

4. Click **Reserve Flight and Continue.** _Note that your itinerary will not be confirmed until you actually submit your authorization for approval-- don't stop here!_
<img src="/images/travel/8a-reserve-flight.png" class="travel-guide-hide" alt="reserving the flight">

5. This will take you to the **Trip Overview**. This page also lists your current reservations.

***Note:** the deadline on the confirmation page. Ensure that you have approval from the TTS Travel Team before this date. Your tickets are booked, but are not purchased until one of them approves.
<img src="/images/travel/9-trip-details.png" class="travel-guide-hide" alt="viewing the Trip Overview">

6. Scroll to the bottom of this page and click **Next**. This message will pop up, prompting you to book a hotel.
<img src="/images/travel/10-trip-details-bottom.png" class="travel-guide-hide" alt="pending reservation warning">

By choosing **"I will book a hotel now."** you will be allowed to book your hotel directly in Concur. Before doing so, please ensure that [your travel card is saved in your Concur profile]({{site.baseurl}}/first-time-travel-complete-concur-profile).

### Book lodging

***Note**: If you don't have a travel card yet, make sure that you've [applied for one]({{site.baseurl}}/first-time-travel-travel-card) (it is required by GSA policy), then choose "I will book a hotel later". Call AdTrav at (877) 472-6716 to reserve your hotel (and rental car if needed) on your personal card in the meantime. Assuming you've already booked your flight or train in Concur, **mention the authorization number associated with your itinerary** so you don't get a second overlapping authorization for your hotel and/or rental car. You can verify your authorization number by going to the "Authorizations" tab in Concur and finding the number in blue on the left side associated with your travel dates. An hour after you call with AdTrav, proceed on to [completing trip information](#completing-trip-information).

#### How to Book a hotel in Concur

1. When you click on the **Next** button after confirming your flights, a popup will appear asking if you'd like to book a hotel now. Select **I will book a hotel now** and click **OK**.
<img src="/images/travel/11-book-hotel-now.png" class="travel-guide-hide" alt="selecting hotel booking option">

***Note:** if you are coming back to this step after going back to the main menu of Concur, make sure your saved authorization is selected, go to **Travel Home**, reopen your itinerary, and then choose "Hotel" under "Add to your Itinerary".

*If you didn't need to book flights or rail, you can go to the **Travel** tab of Concur and make your reservations selecting the "hotel only" option.

2. Enter check-in and check-out dates, location, any preferred hotels, and then click next.

3. Confirm the per diem location and click next. The maximum lodging rate and M&IE allowance is indicated below.

4. Choose a hotel from the list of search results. Unless you have approval otherwise, or intend to pay for the difference in price personally, sure that you pick a hotel with a nightly rate **equal to or less than the government maximum for the area listed [here](https://www.gsa.gov/travel/plan-book/per-diem-rates/per-diem-rates-lookup).** In the side bar you can filter your search results to only those under the Per diem rate by checking **Hide hotels over Per Diem limit ($XXX.00)**.

5. Click on  **View Rooms**, to view a detailed list of rooms within the hotel and select the room by clicking on the listed price at right.

6. **Review and Reserve Hotel** On the review screen:
    * Select your hotel room preferences
    * Choose a credit card
    * Agree to the hotel's rate policies.
    * Click on **Reserve Hotel and Continue**

7. You will now be taken back to your trip itinerary. Note that the hotel has been added to the flight.

8. Scroll down and click **Next** and [complete your trip information](#completing-trip-information), or if needed, continue on to [reserve a rental car](#booking-a-rental-car).

#### Can I book outside of Concur?

Unless there are extenuating circumstances, you should use Concur for all reservations (flights, hotels, and rental cars). If you choose to book a hotel outside of Concur, include a justification that corresponds with one of the following (from the Federal Travel Regulation):

1. When you are attending a conference where the conference sponsor has negotiated with one or more lodging facilities to set aside a specific number of rooms for conference attendees and to ensure that a set aside room is available to you, you are required to book lodging directly with the lodging facility.

2. When your travel is to a remote location and it is not possible to book lodging accommodations through the TMS or ETS (Concur).

3. When such travel arrangements are so complex and circumstance will not allow you to book your travel through an online self-service booking tool (Concur).

If you need to book a hotel outside of Concur, check if booking comes with any nonrefundable fees. If it does, make sure that you get your authorizing official to approve the approximate amount of what is nonrefundable and send the email to tts-travelauths@gsa.gov. **Nonrefundable hotel fees that are not pre-approved are the traveler’s liability.** Should booking a hotel in Concur or via AdTrav not be possible, [Fedrooms](https://fedrooms.com) offers hotels within government maximum rates that have flexible cancellation policies.

When you are finished booking your hotel, proceed on to [complete trip information](#completing-trip-information).

### Booking a Rental Car

**Before booking a rental car** ensure that manager or client who approved your travel explicitly approved budget for a rental car-- in certain situations, rental cars and parking charges are not as advantageous to the government as common carriers such as taxis and/or public transit. Government vehicles may also be available-- check out the guide [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19D9YBPELZav3Y-gNUxEVS4wBbV89iUTUeirH46rE378/edit) for more details.

*If you didn't need to book flights, rail, or hotel, you can go to the **Travel** tab of Concur and make your reservations selecting the "rental car only" option.

### How to Book A Rental Car in Concur

1. From the itinerary page, choose "Car" under "Add to your Itinerary" and then select the trip leg when prompted.

2. Indicate pick-up and drop-off dates, location(s), car type, and preferred vendor(s).

***Note** GSA employees are required to use the lowest cost compact car unless approved for a larger vehicle based on meeting one or more of the justifications listed in [FTR §301-10.450(c)](https://www.gsa.gov/policy-regulations/regulations/federal-travel-regulation-ftr?asset=107365#i1205588).

3. Confirm your email address and travel card information, and then **Reserve Car and Continue.**

**Important notes:**

Be aware that the rental company you select must participate in the [Defense Travel Management Office's (DTMO) Rental Car Program](https://www.defensetravel.dod.mil/site/rentalCar.cfm). Rental car companies participating in the program established ceiling rates; unlimited mileage (except for one-way rentals); vehicle contract will be ready upon arrival; if size/class reserved is not available, the company will offer an upgrade at the same cost; no underage drivers’ fee for drivers between the ages of 18-25; no minimum rental period; no cost for additional drivers; and full coverage insurance for damages resulting from an accident while performing official travel.

The Government is self-insured and rental vehicles under the DTMO agreement include full coverage for damages resulting from
an accident while performing official travel. Employees on TDY travel within CONUS will not be reimbursed for collision damage waiver (CDW) or theft insurance available on commercial rental contracts. Employees will be reimbursed for collision damage waiver or theft insurance while on TDY in non-foreign areas in accordance with [FTR §301-10.451](https://www.gsa.gov/policy-regulations/regulations/federal-travel-regulation-ftr?asset=107365#d25e5538). Personal liability insurance is considered a personal expense and will not be reimbursed.

Once you have reserved your rental car, continue on to [complete trip information](#completing-trip-information).

## Questions about securing approvals

### Completing Trip Information

On the **Trip Booking Information** page you must enter some general information in order to ensure that your trip gets billed to the right client and/or budget.

***Note:** If you called Ad Trav to book travel, you'll need to open [Concur](https://travel.gsa.gov) about an hour after your initial call to AdTrav, going to the **Authorizations** tab, clicking on your authorization, and selecting **Edit Authorization**. This will open up the document, where you can go to the **General** tab and see the fields that are presented below:

### How to Complete Your Trip Information

1. Enter the following trip information on this page:
<img src="/images/travel/12-trip-name.png" class="travel-guide-hide" alt="Trip Booking Information screen">

**Trip name:** Identify the budget of your trip here, based on the type of project you are traveling for:

* _Billable projects:_ for 18F and CoE, include the exact name and number of the project as it appears in [Tock](https://tock.18f.gov/projects). For PIF billable travel, simply indicate the project is billable.
* _All other projects:_ include the name of the team budget that is paying for this travel (a list of options is in cell C5 of the [TTS Budget and Accounting Lookup](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1twEX5wrriQ3Tbn25wN4n8rZPF9h5NqRQWIskkW6xQpY/edit#gid=0)

***Note:** If you are traveling for multiple projects (whether billable or not), list all of the relevant Tock name and numbers and budget names as appropriate.

Examples:

* `BILLABLE: 18F / HHS / CMS FY19 #997`
* `BILLABLE: CoE / USDA Phase 2 / Cloud Adoption #980`
* `BILLABLE: PIF - DHS`
* `NONBILLABLE: OPP Smarter IT Solutions Division (QXD)`
* `NONBILLABLE: 18F Strategy Branch (QEAD)`
* `NONBILLABLE: Cloud Adoption CoE`

**Type Code:** "SINGLE TRIP".
**Trip Purpose:** “Mission (Operational)” in most cases, unless attending a conference or training.
**Document detail:** Brief summary of the purpose of the trip.
**Will this travel be a detail to another location?** No.

2. Proceed by clicking **Next** to finalize the reservation.

***Note:** You will now see the final reservation. Review all of the details and hit **“Confirm booking”** when done.
<img src="/images/travel/13-confirm-booking.png" class="travel-guide-hide" alt="confirming the booking">

#### Additional step if you booked your hotel outside of Concur or Ad Trav
***Note:** If you did not book a hotel from Concur, a policy violation will be flagged. If this applies to you, [briefly justify your hotel choice](#can-i-book-outside-of-concur).

#### Additional step if you are extending travel for personal reasons

[Deleting hotel expenses](#deleting-expenses) which autopopulate on your authorization is relatively straighforward, but [an additional step is required](#how-can-i-remove-extra-days-at-personal-expense-from-my-authorization-or-voucher) to remove M&IE. In some cases, Concur may not allow you to do this on the authorization. If that's the case, proceed as normal and return to this step when creating your voucher after you get back.

### How to Justify Rental Cars and Personal Vehicle Mileage

In most cases, you can proceed straight on to [stamping and submitting for travel team approval at this point](#how-to-stamp-and-submit-for-travel-team-approval). However, since "common carrier" transit (e.g. public transit, flights, trains, buses, shuttles, taxis, etc) or a [government car](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19D9YBPELZav3Y-gNUxEVS4wBbV89iUTUeirH46rE378/edit#) are the preferred modes of transit for official GSA travel, additional justification is required if you intend to incur the following expenses:

* **Rental Cars:** You must [add a comment](#how-should-i-claim-local-transportation-expenses) on the  "Expenses and Receipts" page justifying the use of a rental car as advantageous to the government (considering both cost and time) compared to common carrier transit or a government car.

* **Mileage:** You must [add this in as an expense](#adding-expenses) on the "Expenses and Receipts" page and then [justify the mileage claim as advantageous to the govenment](#how-should-i-claim-local-transportation-expenses) (considering both cost and time) compared to common carrier transit, government car, and rental car. Mileage from your home to the airport (plus associated parking fees or round-trip travel in case of a drop-off) need only be justified as advantageous compared to taxi and public transit, as it is understood that obtaining a government car or rental car is impractical over such a short distance.

### How to Stamp and Submit for Travel Team Approval

Following this step will ensure your authorization or voucher is in SUBMIT TO APPROVER status, which is required for your request to be reviewed, approved, and ticketed. Before you submit, you can review [this Checklist](https://goo.gl/AWbT7Q) to ensure you've addressed all potential issues that can result in your request getting rejected or returned for correction.

1. Click **Document Actions -> Submit Document** (in the upper right hand corner of your authorization)

2. You will be taken to a document history page. If your **“Status to Apply”** is **“Submit to Approver”**, then click **Stamp and Submit Document** at either the top or the bottom of the page and continue. If not, please correct any other failures.

3. The next page will show you your **pre-audit results**. These will let you know if anything might be awry, which is represented by either a _FAIL_ or a _HARDFAIL_. Many of these are not a cause for concern as long as you secure approvals in the right way. For a more detailed guide on what to do for each _FAIL_ or _HARDFAIL_, read on [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zD020XAXRIpuXPKgY0zadLBNJmBaRj_29-DhClrkZAo/edit). As long as you don't have any hardfails, you are clear to **Continue Stamping the Document**

4. If you successfully stamped the document, you be taken to a page with the button **Close Post Stamping Document Closure Screen**. It doesn’t look like it, but when you see that button, you are done! Your authorization has been submitted. You don’t even have to click the button again (but you can if you want).

5. In the case of authorizations, your travel will be approved by the TTS travel team once you have [secured approval from your authorizing official](#how-to-secure-authorizing-official-approval). Ensure this is complete by 3:30 PM Eastern, else your travel will not be approved until the next business day. If you require approval after business hours, see the guide for after-hours and emergency travel [here]({{site.baseurl}}/travel-guide-b-after-hours-emergency-travel-authorizations).

*For vouchers, your travel will be approved within 3-5 business days.

6. Once you have been approved by the TTS travel team, you should recieve a notification from Concur. Please note that in most cases, **government contract airfare does not ticket until 72 hours before departure**, so you may not recieve official confirmation of your itinerary until then. Don't worry about this, the TTS travel team is not aware of any situations where approved travelers have not been issued tickets :)

*For vouchers, reimbursement will be issued to your personal account and travel card 3-5 business days after travel team approval. For issues with reimbursement, read on more [here](#issues-with-reimbursement)

Once your authorization is approved and ticketed, you might want to take a look at [what to expect while traveling]({{site.baseurl}}/travel-guide-2-travel/)!

### How to secure authorizing official approval

You must formally request your authorizing official's approval* via email and forward it to tts-travelauths@gsa.gov, unless you are traveling to a training, conference, speaking event, or other "IRL" or large team gathering, in which case you must follow [the event request process instead](#how-can-i-get-my-travel-approved-to-attend-a-training-conference-speaking-event-or-other-irl-or-large-team-gathering).          **[Who is my authorizing official?](#who-is-my-authorizing-official-and-what-is-my-budget)**
<br>
<br>
The body of the email must include the following:     [See an individual template here]({{site.baseurl}}/travel-guide-email-templates/#email-template-for-individual-travel) and [a group template here]({{site.baseurl}}/travel-guide-email-templates/#email-template-for-group-travel)

* Names of individuals traveling    [What if this changes?](#what-if-who-is-traveling-changes)
* Start and end dates of travel    [What if I am extending travel for personal reasons?](#what-if-i-am-extending-travel-for-personal-reasons)
* A brief description of work to be done on the trip
* Identified budget that will be paying for the trip    [How do I identify my budget?](#who-is-my-authorizing-official-and-what-is-my-budget)
* Origin and destinations for each individual    [What if I am returning to or traveling from a location other than home?](#what-if-i-am-returning-to-or-traveling-from-a-location-other-than-home)
* Estimated expenses for each individual, including a sufficient budget for local travel and miscellaneous expenses such baggage fees   [How should I estimate my expenses?](#how-should-i-estimate-my-expenses)

*_Note that in many cases, your engagement manager or team lead may request approval on behalf of the group-- reach out to them before emailing your authorizing official._

#### Who is my authorizing official and what is my budget?

Your authorizing official must be a supervisor or director at GSA.

If your travel is **nonbillable**, and coming from your team's budget, your authorizing official would be your supervisor or director. If expenses will be paid out of another team's budget (list of budgets available in cell C5 of [this sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1twEX5wrriQ3Tbn25wN4n8rZPF9h5NqRQWIskkW6xQpY/edit#gid=0)), you will need a supervisor or director from that team to approve.

If your travel is **billable** you will need to get approval from the director of the team who oversees the type of project you are working on:

* 18F Custom Partner Solutions: Alex Bisker
* 10x : Nico Papafil
* cloud.gov: Carlo Costino
* login.gov: Alex Dalessio
* Centers of Excellence: Bob DeLuca or Brian Whittaker

#### What if I am traveling for multiple projects?

Secure approval from each authorizing official as you would normally, but with an eye on which project will be covering each expense. When [completing your trip information in Concur](#completing-trip-information), ensure that either the Trip Name or Document Detail mentions that the travel will be split between multiple projects. If more than one authorizing official has approved expenses for a particular day or leg of the itinerary, clarify which project will be paying for each part of the trip, either via email to tts-travelauths@gsa.gov or comment in the Trip Name or Document Detail sections of Concur. Splitting overall trip costs by a percentage is acceptable as well, as long as the split is agreed upon by all parties.

Another common situation which arises when splitting travel across multiple projects is having days in between, such as a weekend in between travel for two projects. Having official travel approved for the days in between, including weekends or leave is possible as long as the following conditions are met:

* It is not possible to reschedule one of the meetings or events to avoid having days in between.
* Considering both the travel time and overall cost, it is advantageous to the government to pay for the hotel and meals for the time in betwen rather than the round trip travel cost of having the employee return home.
* One or both [authorizing officials](#who-is-my-authorizing-official-and-what-is-my-budget) agree to cover the costs of the time in between.

*_Note that this same situation may arise when travel is required for one project on both sides of a weekend-- the same considerations apply._

#### How can I get my travel approved to attend a training, conference, speaking event, or other "IRL" or large team gathering*?

Instead of obtaining an email of approval, you must follow the [event request process](https://handbook.18f.gov/conferences-events-training/). You may [book your travel]({{site.baseurl}}/travel-guide-1-book-travel/#brief-overview-of-booking-travel) in the meantime.<br>
<br>
However, if you will be [extending your trip at your own expense]({{site.baseurl}}/travel-guide-faq/#what-if-i-am-extending-travel-for-personal-reasons), [flying to or from points that are not either your duty station or location of the event]({{site.baseurl}}/travel-guide-faq/#what-if-i-am-returning-to-or-traveling-from-a-location-other-than-home), or combining your event travel with travel for some other reason, you must secure an email from your [authorizing official](#who-is-my-authorizing-official-and-what-is-my-budget) approving of the revised itinerary.

*The threshold for a large team gathering is over 6 employees traveling for an internal management meeting (not day-to-day business) and/or more than $10,000 in estimated travel expenses for the group. Requests for approval of these events is typically handled by the organizer of the meeting.

#### What if who is traveling changes?

A follow-up to the original email from the authorizing official indicating who the new travel is, and if there is any change in dates or estimated cost is sufficient.

#### What if I am extending travel for personal reasons?

Include language that specifies which days will be at your own expense, and acknowledge that "I understand all other travel expenses including lodging and meals before or after the official travel dates specified above are my own responsibility." You may [remove hotels and M&IE](#additional-step-if-you-are-extending-travel-for-personal-reasons) from your authorization in Concur if you haven't already.

Alternatively, you may book your official travel and have it approved as normal. Once your travel has been approved by the travel team in Concur, you may then call AdTrav at (877) 472-6716 and request to be rebooked on a different flight for personal travel. In the case of most government contract flights, there is no additional charge. However, if there is an additional cost compared to your original itinerary, AdTrav will request you provide a personal credit or debit card number to pay for the difference.

#### What if I am returning to or traveling from a location other than home?

If you were previously scheduled to be on leave or telework at the other location*, the full cost of travel from or to that location can be approved at the discretion of your authorizing official. Ensure that there is language in the email that reflects your itinerary.

If you'd like to schedule personal travel that's incidental to your work trip (i.e. planned after the work trip), after your official work itinerary has been approved in Concur, you can give AdTrav a call at (877) 472-6716 and request that your itinerary be changed for personal reasons, with you covering any difference in cost that may arise.

*Note that while GSA travel policy doesn't explicitly forbid being approved to travel from a foreign location, [travel to or from foreign locations](#international-travel) must be requested in Event Tracker for GSA Administrator approval at least 7 weeks in advance, making approval in these circumstances extremely unlikely.

#### International travel

All official international travel taken by GSA employees, regardless of funding source, requires Salesforce event approval. Please reach out to michael.proul@gsa.gov at least 7 weeks in advance in order to coordinate this.

Teleworking from locations outside the U.S. while on personal travel is not allowed.

#### How should I estimate my expenses

In the case of individual or small group travel, you may estimate your expenses based on the total amount of your authorization in Concur, plus an reasonable allowance for any additional expenses such as taxis, parking, and baggage fees.

For larger group travel, it is recommended to use this [travel expenses estimator template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uJaGMXJOwURruaPdV7PU5B7Q22_iyF8Q2Gk2uamDG8Y/edit#gid=0) which automatically calculates most airfare and per diems.

## Questions about reimbursement

#### How do I create a "Voucher from authorization"?

After selecting **Voucher from authorization**, you will be led through creating a voucher from your authorization that you got approved prior to traveling.

* Under Document Search, you’ll see a list of your “open” authorizations (i.e. your authorizations that don’t have vouchers yet).

* Hit the pencil button to select the authorization you’d like to be reimbursed for. You will be moved onto the next step, [Reviewing and completing trip information](#completing-trip-information) on the **Document Information** screen.

* **TIP**: If you can't figure out which authorization is your recent trip by name, look at the departure date column.

Once you've selected your authorization and continue, you'll be taken to the **Document Information** page. This should all be autopopulated, so unless some of the details of your trip changed, no further action is required here and you may continue on to **Create Document** and start [adding your expenses](#how-to-add-edit-or-delete-expenses). More guidance on what receipts or justifications are required can be found [here](#when-are-receipts-or-further-justifications-required-to-claim-expenses)

##### What if I can't find my authorization listed here?

If you can't find your authorization on this list, it may be because an amended authorization was generated for you. If you changed your trip such that trip dates or locations fall outside what was originally approved, you'll need to [submit that amended auth for approval](#how-to-stamp-and-submit-for-travel-team-approval) by going to the **Authorizations** tab, selecting the amended authorization corresponding to your trip, and going in to **Open Document**.

However, in some cases, Concur will generate an amendement in error. If you suspect this is the case, head to the **Authorizations** tab, select the amended authorization corresponding to your trip, and **Delete Document**

#### How do I create a local or miscellaneous voucher?

Upon selecting the **Local voucher** option, you will be taken to a blank **Document Information** page. Here's what you need to include for each field:

* **Trip Name** This should follow [the same naming conventions you would use for a travel authorization](#how-to-complete-your-trip-information). Ensure you have [an email from your authorizing official](#how-to-secure-authorizing-official-approval) approving all of the expenses you'd like to claim sent to tts-travelauths@gsa.gov.

* **Type code** and **Trip purpose** If the voucher is for local travel (taxis, mileage, etc.), choose **Local travel**. For any other sort of reimbursement, choose **Misc voucher**.

* **Document detail** Enter a brief description of what the reimbursement is for here.

* Click on **Create Document**

Proceed on to [entering your expenses](#how-to-add-edit-or-delete-expenses). Note that any local transit over $25 requires a receipt, and all expenses claimed on a miscellaneous voucher require receipts.

#### Questions about entering specific expenses

##### How should I claim meals and incidental expenses?

* **The allowance for Meals and Incidental Expenses (M&IE) is a flat rate given to a traveler regardless of what they actually spent.** No receipts or justification is needed to receive M&IE.

* **For example**: Consider a trip taken between 9/16 and 9/18. M&IE is $69 per day in DC, and is 75% of $69 ($51.75) on the first and last days of a trip. We see that the three days of M&IE has been added automatically.

##### How should I claim meals paid on the travel card?

When meals are paid on the travel card, there are a few different ways of documenting it:

* One can create a new M&IE expense with expense method **IBA** in the amount spent on meals per day. The amount of M&IE reimbursed to your personal account will be automatically reduced accordingly (you will see negative charges appear that correspond with this). If you document all expenses correctly, your travel card bill will be paid off exactly.

* One can change the payment method of M&IE expenses to **IBA** so that all reimbursement is routed to the travel card. If the entire allowance was not used, any amount left over will show up as a positive balance. You may call the customer service number on the back of the card and request that a check be mailed for that remaining amount.

* One can leave the payment method of M&IE expenses as the default, **CASH**. After the voucher is processed, there will be an outstanding balance remaining. This will need to be paid-- call the customer service number on the back of the card for more details on making a payment.

##### How can I remove extra days at personal expense from my authorization or voucher?

If you were authorized to extend your trip at your own expense and need to delete M&IE, there are some special instructions that you should follow:

1. Edit your first *full* day of travel at your own expense by clicking on the pencil icon.

2. Click on the **View Per Diem Conditions**. You should see a menu expand below.

3. Choose **M&IE Override**, then **Override by amount**, and **0**.

4. Check **On leave**. Use **Other leave**, **8 hours**.

5. If you are requesting leave for multiple days, return to the top and enter in the last *full* day you are traveling at personal expense.

5. Save. Your M&IE should show as zero for the day. If it didn't work, just go ahead an add in a comment about the days you would like to zero out in the comments field, and the travel team will take that into account when they review your voucher for approval.

#### How should I claim hotels and lodging taxes?

If you booked a hotel in Concur, your actual hotel expenses should populate automatically. However, that automatic amount will often lump in the taxes, which should be considered a separate list.

First, attach your receipt to the first night of lodging only, unless you have multiple receipts. Note that Concur will flag all expenses needing receipts

Then, [correct the lodging expenses](#editing-expenses) so they reflect the actual nightly rate paid, not including taxes.

Finally, [add a new expense for lodging taxes in](#adding-expenses), keeping in mind the following:

* **Create Expenses Through:** Enter the last night you were checked into the hotel, and each night’s lodging tax will be copied through.

* **Expense Date:** The night that you checked in.

* **Expense Description:** Lodging Tax

* **Cost:** Tax per night (tax can also be reported as a lump sum, though lodging itself must be broken out per night)

* **Payment Method:** Travel card -> **IBA**, and other form of payment -> **CASH**

Don't forget to **Save!**

#### How should I claim air or Amtrak booked outside of Concur
Any airfare or Amtrak tickets booked outside of Concur are *at your own risk* and may not be approved. If you are seeking reimbursement for personally booked airfare or Amtrak, you must choose **Other - Miscellaneous** as the expense description, and in the comments section under **Show other details**, you must provide a justification as to why it was not possible for you to book your travel via Concur or AdTrav.

#### How can I get reimbursed for professional liability insurance?

Supervisors may be reimbursed for up to half the cost of professional liability insurance, up to $150. In order to claim reimbursement, get an email from your supervisor approving the amount of the reimbursement you intend to claim and send it to tts-travelauths@gsa.gov. Then, create a [miscellaneous voucher](#how-do-i-create-a-local-or-miscellaneous-voucher) in [Concur](https://travel.gsa.gov) and [attach the receipt](#attaching-receipts) you recieved after purchasing the insurance.

#### How should I claim local transportation expenses?

For public transit, taxis, rental cars, POV mileage and other forms of local transportation, you may [add the expense as normal](#adding-expenses), choosing whichever expense description reflects the nature of the method used. Choose the [payment method used](#selecting-payment-type), and [upload a receipt](#attaching-receipts) only for rental cars, rental car gas, or any other expense greater than $75 (this threshold is $25 for [local vouchers](#how-do-i-create-a-local-or-miscellaneous-voucher).

Any local transit expense other than public transit under $25 requires a brief comment describing the origin and destination of the travel (e.g. "from airport to office").

You can add this by clicking on **Show other details** and filling out the **Comments** section that pops up below.

For public transit over $25, a “blanket entry” describing generally the origins and destinations of travel paid for is acceptable.

For rental cars and mileage claims, the comment should also include an additional justification as specified [here](#how-to-justify-rental-cars-and-personal-vehicle-mileage).

For mileage claims over $75, instead of attaching a receipt, attach a screenshot showing a map of your itinerary with the calculated distance.

### Issues with reimbursement

#### I recieved a bill for an outstanding balance on my travel card. Should I pay it?

A: First, verify that your most recent voucher was paid to the travel card account. Go to the **Vouchers** tab of Concur, then click on the voucher number you want to view and choose **View Summary**. In the voucher view, navigate down to the **Totals and travel advances** section and verify the amount on the **Pay to Charge Card** line. This amount should match with a payment made to the travel card in your travel card statement. [Links + Instructions for viewing online statements here]({{site.baseurl}}/first-time-travel-travel-card/#4-receive-and-activate-your-card-in-7-10-business-days) If it does, and there is still a remaining balance, it is likely that you used the travel card to pay for something that was either claimed as **CASH** on the voucher, or not claimed at all.

If you discover a valid charge to your travel card that you need to be reimbursed for after your voucher is initially approved, you may create an [amended voucher](#how-do-i-amend-my-voucher-after-it-is-approved).

If you were reimbursed to your bank account for a charge made on your travel card, you will have to pay the bill for it. Contact the number on the back of your travel card for details on how payment can be made.

#### Positive balance on travel card

If you have a positive balance on the travel card, it is likely that you claimed an expense as paid for on the travel card when you actually paid for it via a personal means of payment. You can call the number on the back of your travel card and request that they mail you a check in the amount of the positive balance.

#### My reimbursement never arrived!

If it has been over a week after your voucher has been approved and your reimbursement hasn't arrived (whether to your travel card account or personal account), contact kc-travel.finance@gsa.gov and describe the issue you are having. cc tts-travel@gsa.gov.

#### How do I amend my voucher after it is approved?

To amend a voucher, go to the **Vouchers** tab of Concur, then click on the voucher number you want to view and choose **Amend voucher**. Provide a brief reason for the amendment, then proceed with [adding your revised expenses](#how-to-add-edit-or-delete-expenses) and [resubmitting for approval](#how-to-stamp-and-submit-for-travel-team-approval). Note that if you want to revise a voucher that has not yet been approved, you can simply **Edit Voucher** instead of amending.

**Note:** Vouchers should NOT be amended in the case of revising the payment method ([IBA to CASH](#positive-balance-on-travel-card) or [vice versa](#i-recieved-a-bill-for-an-outstanding-balance-on-my-travel-card-should-i-pay-it), or reducing a claim on an already-approved expense. If you were over-reimbursed for something, you will need to mail a check for that amount, made out to GSA to the following address:

USDA-OCFO
Financial Operations & Disbursement Branch
Attn:  Bryan DeLeve - 2SE
2300 Main Street
Kansas City, MO 64108

Reference the authorization and voucher number along with the payment.
