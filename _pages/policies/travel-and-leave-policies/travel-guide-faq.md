## Questions about booking travel

### How to Book Flights or Rail

#### Enter your Destination, then Origin

1. Go to Concur at [travel.gsa.gov](http://travel.gsa.gov)

2. In the shortcuts menu on the upper left hand corner, select **Travel - New Booking**

3. Click on the **Air/Rail** icon (this should be already selected). If you need to travel by train only, choose the **Rail** icon instead.

***Note:** If you need to travel by both air and rail, call AdTrav at (877) 472-6716 and they will make your reservations for you. An hour after your call, skip ahead to [this step](/#completing-trip-information) to submit your AdTrav reservation for approval.

4. Type in the name of your destination city in *Temporary Duty Location* search field, and click on the search icon. You must search by city, not address. Select the correct location from the drop-down.
<img src="/images/travel/2-choose-departure.png" class="travel-guide-hide" alt="choosing destination city">

***Note:** The destination city is entered before the departure city

6. When selecting your location it will auto-populate ‘TDY Per Diem Location’. This is the Per Diem allowance amount for that location.
<img src="/images/travel/3-autofil-per-diem.png" class="travel-guide-hide" alt="auto-fill of Per Diem Location">

7. Choose your departure city and airport
<img src="/images/travel/4-choose-origin-city.png" class="travel-guide-hide" alt="choosing origin city">

8. Click **Search** to move onto the next screen.

#### How to Choose a Flight

When choosing flights, you may notice they fall into four different categories:

<img src="/images/travel/5-view-select-flights.png" class="travel-guide-hide" alt="Concur flight selection screen">

* **Govt. Contract Discounted:** the preferred option. In general, these fares are only available 15 or more days in advance, so try to book your travel as early as possible.

* **Govt. Contract:** the standard option, based on the [city pair rate](https://cpsearch.fas.gsa.gov/cpsearch/search.do?method=enter), the agreed upon rate for government flights between two cities. These are preferred if no govt. contract discounted fares are available.

* **Non-contract Government:** these fares are also acceptable to book if the timing is more advantageous. All these fares are within the City Pair rate and are fully refundable. No additional approvals are required to book a non-contract government fare.

* **Lowest published:** while these fares may come at a lower cost than the contract options, they also come at increased risk to the government because many of these fares are nonrefundable. Any flight that is nonrefundable must be explicitly approved by the authorizing official before the TTS travel team can approve. If you think that choosing a "Lowest published" nonrefundable fare is your best option, skip ahead to [securing your approval email now](/travel-guide-2-secure-approvals), and then come back to book later. You'll want to ensure you secure the approval before you book because these fares expire quickly, often before authorizing official and travel team approval can be reasonably obtained.

***Note about flights with policy violations:**

If you need to take a flight which indicates a policy violation, the type of violation will inform what steps you need to take next. Click on "View Fares" to pull up additional details about your flight selection.

If any part of the fare that you chose is nonrefundable, or exceeds the [City Pair rate](http://cpsearch.fas.gsa.gov/cpsearch/search.do?method=enter) (note that lookup values here are for one-way fares), you will need an additional email approving the risk of nonrefundable airfare and/or additional costs from [your authorizing official](/travel-guide-2-secure-approvals/#who-is-my-authorizing-official-and-what-is-my-budget) sent to tts-travelauths@gsa.gov.

[What justifies using a non-contract fare?](https://www.gsa.gov/policy-regulations/regulations/federal-travel-regulation-ftr?asset=107365#i1204997)

1. Select **View Fares** to view additional itinerary details
<img src="/images/travel/6-view-fares.png" class="travel-guide-hide" alt="viewing fares">

2. Select the lowest cost, most compliant fare available by clicking on the blue button at right with the price. This will take you onto the confirmation page.

<img src="/images/travel/7-flight-details.png" class="travel-guide-hide" alt="selecting a flight">

3. **Review and Reserve Flight:** Review your flight itinerary, passenger information, frequent flyer information.
<img src="/images/travel/8-passenger-info.png" class="travel-guide-hide" alt="reviewing the flight">

4. Click **Reserve Flight and Continue.** _Note that your itinerary will not be confirmed until you actually submit your authorization for approval-- don't stop here!_
<img src="/images/travel/8a-reserve-flight.png" class="travel-guide-hide" alt="reserving the flight">

5. This will take you to the **Trip Overview**. This page also lists your current reservations. 

***Note:** the deadline on the confirmation page. Ensure that you have approval from the TTS Travel Team before this date. Your tickets are booked, but are not purchased until one of them approves.
<img src="/images/travel/9-trip-details.png" class="travel-guide-hide" alt="viewing the Trip Overview">

6. Scroll to the bottom of this page and click **Next**. This message will pop up, prompting you to book a hotel.
<img src="/images/travel/10-trip-details-bottom.png" class="travel-guide-hide" alt="pending reservation warning">

By choosing **"I will book a hotel now."** you will be allowed to book your hotel directly in Concur. Before doing so, please ensure that [your travel card is saved in your Concur profile](/first-time-travel-complete-concur-profile).

### Book lodging

***Note**: If you don't have a travel card yet, make sure that you've [applied for one](/first-time-travel-travel-card) (it is required by GSA policy), then choose "I will book a hotel later". Call AdTrav at (877) 472-6716 to reserve your hotel (and rental car if needed) on your personal card in the meantime. Assuming you've already booked your flight or train in Concur, **mention the authorization number associated with your itinerary** so you don't get a second overlapping authorization for your hotel and/or rental car. You can verify your authorization number by going to the "Authorizations" tab in Concur and finding the number in blue on the left side associated with your travel dates. An hour after you call with AdTrav, proceed on to [completing trip information](/#completing-trip-information).

#### How to Book a hotel in Concur

1. When you click on the **Next** button after confirming your flights, a popup will appear asking if you'd like to book a hotel now. Select **I will book a hotel now** and click **OK**.
<img src="/images/travel/11-book-hotel-now.png" class="travel-guide-hide" alt="selecting hotel booking option">

***Note:** if you are coming back to this step after going back to the main menu of Concur, make sure your saved authorization is selected, go to **Travel Home**, reopen your itinerary, and then choose "Hotel" under "Add to your Itinerary".

*If you didn't need to book flights or rail, you can go to the **Travel** tab of Concur and make your reservations selecting the "hotel only" option.

2. Enter check-in and check-out dates, location, any preferred hotels, and then click next.

3. Confirm the per diem location and click next. The maximum lodging rate and M&IE allowance is indicated below.

4. Choose a hotel from the list of search results. Unless you have approval otherwise, or intend to pay for the difference in price personally, sure that you pick a hotel with a nightly rate **equal to or less than the government maximum for the area listed [here](https://www.gsa.gov/travel/plan-book/per-diem-rates/per-diem-rates-lookup).** In the side bar you can filter your search results to only those under the Per diem rate by checking **Hide hotels over Per Diem limit ($XXX.00)**.

5. Click on  **View Rooms**, to view a detailed list of rooms within the hotel and select the room by clicking on the listed price at right.

6. **Review and Reserve Hotel** On the review screen:
    * Select your hotel room preferences
    * Choose a credit card
    * Agree to the hotel's rate policies.
    * Click on **Reserve Hotel and Continue**

7. You will now be taken back to your trip itinerary. Note that the hotel has been added to the flight.

8. Scroll down and click **Next** and [securing approvals](/travel-guide-2-securing approvals), or if needed, continue on to [reserve a rental car](/#booking-a-rental-car).

#### Can I book outside of Concur?

Unless there are extenuating circumstances, you should use Concur for all reservations (flights, hotels, and rental cars). If you choose to book a hotel outside of Concur, include a justification that corresponds with one of the following (from the Federal Travel Regulation):

1. When you are attending a conference where the conference sponsor has negotiated with one or more lodging facilities to set aside a specific number of rooms for conference attendees and to ensure that a set aside room is available to you, you are required to book lodging directly with the lodging facility.

2. When your travel is to a remote location and it is not possible to book lodging accommodations through the TMS or ETS (Concur).

3. When such travel arrangements are so complex and circumstance will not allow you to book your travel through an online self-service booking tool (Concur).

If you need to book a hotel outside of Concur, check if booking comes with any nonrefundable fees. If it does, make sure that you get your authorizing official to approve the approximate amount of what is nonrefundable and send the email to tts-travelauths@gsa.gov. **Nonrefundable hotel fees that are not pre-approved are the traveler’s liability.** Should booking a hotel in Concur or via AdTrav not be possible, [Fedrooms](fedrooms.com) offers hotels within government maximum rates that have flexible cancellation policies.

When you are finished booking your hotel, proceed on to [complete trip information]((/#completing-trip-information)).

### Booking a Rental Car

**Before booking a rental car** ensure that manager or client who approved your travel explicitly approved budget for a rental car-- in certain situations, rental cars and parking charges are not as advantageous to the government as common carriers such as taxis and/or public transit. Government vehicles may also be available-- check out the guide [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19D9YBPELZav3Y-gNUxEVS4wBbV89iUTUeirH46rE378/edit) for more details.

*If you didn't need to book flights, rail, or hotel, you can go to the **Travel** tab of Concur and make your reservations selecting the "rental car only" option.

### How to Book A Rental Car in Concur

1. From the itinerary page, choose "Car" under "Add to your Itinerary" and then select the trip leg when prompted.

2. Indicate pick-up and drop-off dates, location(s), car type, and preferred vendor(s).

***Note** GSA employees are required to use the lowest cost compact car unless approved for a larger vehicle based on meeting one or more of the justifications listed in [FTR §301-10.450(c)](https://www.gsa.gov/policy-regulations/regulations/federal-travel-regulation-ftr?asset=107365#i1205588).

3. Confirm your email address and travel card information, and then **Reserve Car and Continue.**

**Important notes:**

Be aware that the rental company you select must participate in the [Defense Travel Management Office's (DTMO) Rental Car Program](https://www.defensetravel.dod.mil/site/rentalCar.cfm). Rental car companies participating in the program established ceiling rates; unlimited mileage (except for one-way rentals); vehicle contract will be ready upon arrival; if size/class reserved is not available, the company will offer an upgrade at the same cost; no underage drivers’ fee for drivers between the ages of 18-25; no minimum rental period; no cost for additional drivers; and full coverage insurance for damages resulting from an accident while performing official travel.

The Government is self-insured and rental vehicles under the DTMO agreement include full coverage for damages resulting from
an accident while performing official travel. Employees on TDY travel within CONUS will not be reimbursed for collision damage waiver (CDW) or theft insurance available on commercial rental contracts. Employees will be reimbursed for collision damage waiver or theft insurance while on TDY in non-foreign areas in accordance with [FTR §301-10.451](https://www.gsa.gov/policy-regulations/regulations/federal-travel-regulation-ftr?asset=107365#d25e5538). Personal liability insurance is considered a personal expense and will not be reimbursed.

Once you have reserved your rental car, continue on to [complete trip information](/#completing-trip-information).

## Questions about securing approvals

### Completing Trip Information

On the **Trip Booking Information** page you must enter some general information in order to ensure that your trip gets billed to the right client and/or budget.

***Note:** If you called Ad Trav to book travel, you'll need to open [Concur](https://travel.gsa.gov) about an hour after your initial call to AdTrav, going to the **Authorizations** tab, clicking on your authorization, and selecting **Edit Authorization**. This will open up the document, where you can go to the **General** tab and see the fields that are presented below:

### How to Complete Your Trip Information 

1. Enter the following trip information on this page:
<img src="/images/travel/12-trip-name.png" class="travel-guide-hide" alt="Trip Booking Information screen">

**Trip name:** Identify the budget of your trip here, based on the type of project you are traveling for:

_Billable projects:_ for 18F and CoE, include the exact name and number of the project as it appears in [Tock](tock.18f.gov/projects). For PIF billable travel, simply indicate the project is billable
_All other projects:_ include the name of the team budget that is paying for this travel (a list of options is in cell C5 of the [TTS Budget and Accounting Lookup](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1twEX5wrriQ3Tbn25wN4n8rZPF9h5NqRQWIskkW6xQpY/edit#gid=0)

***Note:** If you are traveling for multiple projects (whether billable or not), list all of the relevant Tock name and numbers and budget names as appropriate.

Examples: 
`BILLABLE: 18F / HHS / CMS FY19 #997`
`BILLABLE: CoE / USDA Phase 2 / Cloud Adoption #980`
`BILLABLE: PIF - DHS`
`NONBILLABLE: OPP Smarter IT Solutions Division (QXD)`
`NONBILLABLE: 18F Strategy Branch (QEAD)`
`NONBILLABLE: Cloud Adoption CoE`
    
**Type Code:** "SINGLE TRIP".
**Trip Purpose:** “Mission (Operational)” in most cases, unless attending a conference or training.
**Document detail:** Brief summary of the purpose of the trip.
**Will this travel be a detail to another location?** No.

2. Proceed by clicking **Next** to finalize the reservation.

***Note:** You will now see the final reservation. Review all of the details and hit **“Confirm booking”** when done.
<img src="/images/travel/13-confirm-booking.png" class="travel-guide-hide" alt="confirming the booking">

#### Additional step if you booked your hotel outside of Concur or Ad Trav
***Note:** If you did not book a hotel from Concur, a policy violation will be flagged. If this applies to you, [briefly justify your hotel choice](/travel-guide-1-book-travel/#can-i-book-outside-of-concur).

### How to Stamp and Submit for Travel Team Approval

Following this step will ensure your authorization or voucher is in SUBMIT TO APPROVER status, which is required for your request to be reviewed, approved, and ticketed. Before you submit, you can review [this Checklist](https://goo.gl/AWbT7Q) to ensure you've addressed all potential issues that can result in your request getting rejected or returned for correction.

1. Click **Document Actions -> Submit Document** (in the upper right hand corner of your authorization)

2. You will be taken to a document history page. If your **“Status to Apply”** is **“Submit to Approver”**, then click **Stamp and Submit Document** at either the top or the bottom of the page and continue. If not, please correct any other failures.

3. The next page will show you your **pre-audit results**. These will let you know if anything might be awry, which is represented by either a _FAIL_ or a _HARDFAIL_. Many of these are not a cause for concern as long as you secure approvals in the right way. For a more detailed guide on what to do for each _FAIL_ or _HARDFAIL_, read on [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zD020XAXRIpuXPKgY0zadLBNJmBaRj_29-DhClrkZAo/edit). As long as you don't have any hardfails, you are clear to **Continue Stamping the Document**

4. If you successfully stamped the document, you be taken to a page with the button **Close Post Stamping Document Closure Screen**. It doesn’t look like it, but when you see that button, you are done! Your authorization has been submitted. You don’t even have to click the button again (but you can if you want).

5. In the case of authorizations, your travel will be approved by the TTS travel team once you have [secured approval from your authorizing official](travel-guide-1-book-travel/#brief-overview-of-securing-approvals). Ensure this is complete by 3:30 PM Eastern, else your travel will not be approved until the next business day. If you require approval after business hours, see the guide for after-hours and emergency travel [here](/travel-guide-B-after-hours-emergency-travel-authorizations).

*For vouchers, your travel will be approved within 3-5 business days.

6. Once you have been approved by the TTS travel team, you should recieve a notification from Concur. Please note that in most cases, **government contract airfare does not ticket until 72 hours before departure**, so you may not recieve official confirmation of your itinerary until then. Don't worry about this, the TTS travel team is not aware of any situations where approved travelers have not been issued tickets :)

*For vouchers, reimbursement will be issued to your personal account and travel card 3-5 business days after travel team approval. For issues with reimbursement, read on more [here](/travel-guide-faq/#issues-with-reimbursement)

Once your authorization is approved and ticketed, you might want to take a look at [what to expect while traveling](/travel-guide-2-travel/)!

### How to secure authorizing official approval

You must formally request your authorizing official's approval via email.*    [Who is my authorizing official](/#who-is-my-authorizing-official-and-what-is-my-budget)

*Note that in many cases, your engagement manager or team lead may request approval on behalf of the group-- reach out to them before emailing your authorizing official.

The body of the email must include the following:     [See an individual template here](/travel-guide-email-templates/#email-template-for-individual-travel) [and a group template here](/travel-guide-email-templates/#email-template-for-group-travel)

* Names of individuals traveling    [What if this changes?](/#what-if-who-is-traveling-changes)
* Start and end dates of travel    [What if I am extending travel for personal reasons?](/#what-if-I-am-extending-travel-for-personal-reasons)
* A brief description of work to be done on the trip
* Identified budget that will be paying for the trip    [How do I identify my budget?](/#who-is-my-authorizing-official-and-what-is-my-budget)
* Origin and destinations for each individual    [What if I am traveling to or returning from a location other than my home location?](/#What-if-I-am-traveling-to-or-returning-from-a-location-other-than-my-home-location)
* Estimated expenses for each individual    [How should I estimate my expenses?](/#How-should-I-estimate-my-expenses)

#### Who is my authorizing official and what is my budget?

Your authorizing official must be a supervisor or director at GSA. 

If your travel is **nonbillable**, and coming from your team's budget, your authorizing official would be your supervisor or director. If expenses will be paid out of another team's budget (list of budgets available in cell C5 of [this sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1twEX5wrriQ3Tbn25wN4n8rZPF9h5NqRQWIskkW6xQpY/edit#gid=0)), you will need a supervisor or director from that team to approve.

If your travel is **billable** you will need to get approval from the director of the team who oversees the type of project you are working on:

* 18F Custom Partner Solutions: Alex Bisker
* 10x : Nico Papafil
* cloud.gov: Carlo Costino
* login.gov: Alex Dalessio
* Centers of Excellence: Bob DeLuca or Brian Whittaker

#### What if who is traveling changes?

A follow-up to the original email from the authorizing official indicating who the new travel is, and if there is any change in dates or estimated cost is sufficient.

#### What if I am extending travel for personal reasons?

Include language that specifies which days will be at your own expense, and acknowledge that "I understand all other travel expenses including lodging and meals before or after the official travel dates specified above are my own responsibility."

#### What if I am traveling to or returning from a location other than my home location?

If you were previously scheduled to be on leave or telework at the other location*, the full cost of travel from or to that location can be approved at the discretion of your authorizing official. Ensure that there is language in the email that reflects your itinerary.

If you'd like to schedule personal travel that's incidental to your work trip (i.e. planned after the work trip), after your official work itinerary has been approved in Concur, you can give AdTrav a call at (877) 472-6716 and request that your itinerary be changed, with you covering any difference in cost that may arise.

*Note that while GSA travel policy doesn't explicitly forbid being approved to travel from a foreign location, [travel to or from foreign locations](/#international-travel) must be requested in Event Tracker for GSA Administrator approval at least 7 weeks in advance, amking approval in these circumstances extremely unlikely.

#### International travel

All official international travel taken by GSA employees, regardless of funding source, also requires Salesforce event approval. Please reach out to michael.proul@gsa.gov at least 7 weeks in advance in order to coordinate this.

#### How should I estimate my expenses

In the case of individual or small group travel, you may estimate your expenses based on the total amount of your authorization in Concur, plus an reasonable allowance for any additional expenses such as taxis, parking, and baggage fees.

For larger group travel, it is recommended to use this [travel expenses estimator template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uJaGMXJOwURruaPdV7PU5B7Q22_iyF8Q2Gk2uamDG8Y/edit#gid=0) which automatically calculates most airfare and per diems.


## Questions about reimbursements

<a name="extend-travel"></a>

###Is it possible to travel before the actual date that I am scheduled to arrive for work at my temporary duty station?  Conversely, may I stay longer than my scheduled days of work?

[Additional Info on this](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1Lxnea7PmBZQeKwe-zkg1XNoIYYhFeglv29ls2NKudLE/edit)

Jaime will be traveling to visit a partner agency in September.  She sees an opportunity to arrive early and visit a few days with family members before beginning her work duties.

This is acceptable.  You will need the authorization of your supervisor.  What you need to know is the following:  You will only be reimbursed for accommodations, local travel costs and per diem during the period for which you are scheduled to work.  Any additional evenings of accommodations (as well as local travel costs and per diem) are on your own dime.  You will have to pay for the nights for which you are staying prior to, or post, your actual scheduled days of work. In addition, your per diem only kicks in during your actual days of scheduled work.

> To: Supervisor
>
> I would like to arrive early for my meeting with [agency] and spend some time with my family. I plan on traveling Friday, September 25, and would return September 30. I understand that all other travel expenses including lodging and meals before Sunday, September 27th are my own responsibility.
>
> Please let me know if this is acceptable.
>
> Thanks.

Note that in the case of billable travel, the email should be made out to the client instead of the supervisor.

<a name="multi-city"></a>

###Can I fly out to a different region (other than my home city) after my scheduled work has ended at my temporary duty station?  Conversely, can I fly in from a different region prior to when my scheduled work begins?

Victor will be meeting with a partner agency in person in late September.  He would like to stay a couple of days on the East Coast after his scheduled work time and take the train up to see a friend in New York.

This is acceptable.  You will need the approval of your supervisor.  Scenario #1 lays out how any time prior to, or immediately after scheduled work days at a temporary duty location, is fine, just make sure you have your supervisor’s approval.  Flying in or out of a region that is not the same as your temporary work stations is also ok.  What you need to understand:  The cost of your transportation from another region will be reimbursed based on the cost to fly from your original temporary duty station back to your home region.  Your total reimbursement will be based on the cost to fly directly from your home city to the temporary duty station.  If it is determined that the cost is actually lower, you are home free.  However, if the cost is determined to be higher, you are liable for the additional amount.  The  will be based on the city pairs program [click here](http://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/104512)

Sample Authorization Email:

> I am requesting Authorization to travel as follows:
>
> I would like to fly from SFO to DCA on Sunday September 27th.  I have verbally been approved to attend the 18F All Hands meeting on Monday September 28th and Tuesday September 29th.  I would also work the following two days Wednesday September 30th and Thursday October 1st collaborating with the DC Operations Team.  I request permission to remain the weekend on the East Coast, and to fly out from the New York City area on Sunday.  I understand I would be responsible for all my accommodations after my Thursday departure from the office and that my reimbursable airfare cost would be based on similar flights from DC area airport to my home airport, and not the actual cost of my return flight.
>
> Thank you.

Again, in the case of billable travel, the email should be made out to the client instead of the supervisor.

<a name="non-contract"></a>

### I found a flight that I like, but it’s not a government contract carrier. Can I still take it?

You may still take a non-contract flight if it follows [these rules set in the Federal Travel Regulation](http://www.gsa.gov/portal/ext/public/site/FTR/file/Chapter301p010.html/category/21868/#wp1203865), and also follows the 18F-specific policy here:

* If the fare that you choose is nonrefundable, or exceeds the [City Pair rate](http://cpsearch.fas.gsa.gov/cpsearch/search.do?method=enter) (note that lookup values here are for one-way fares), you will need an additional email of approval from your client (billable) or director (non-billable) sent to tts-travelauths@gsa.gov.


<a name="adtrav"></a>

### What do I do differently when I book with AdTrav?

AdTrav can expedite the booking of your flight (if you are less than 3 days away from travel), but there are still a few actions that you need to complete in Concur.  [Note:  Online reservations are only $8.36 per reservation vs. $34.30 to speak to an AdTrav agent.  Once ticketed, should you need to make changes to your reservations, you will again be charged another $34.30.  You should only use an agent in extreme cases, such as less than three days notice to travel.]

**Note:** Dates of travel should be confirmed in this e-mail, including any extension of travel for personal reasons. This includes, but is not limited to:

* Extending your stay in your travel location for the weekend before or following a trip (or for additional workdays in which your travel is not essential).

* 18F will pay for the cost of your flight on an alternative date but not your meals or lodging for those additional days.

* Flying to your travel location from another place that is not your home city and/or flying from your travel location to another place that is not your home city.

* 18F will pay for a flight that is equal to or less than in price to the least expensive compliant flight between your home city and travel location. For flights that are more expensive, you are responsible for the difference in price.

*Got questions? Ask [#travel](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/messages/travel)*, [tts-travel@gsa.gov](mailto:tts-travel@gsa.gov), or book office hours [here](https://sites.google.com/a/gsa.gov/tts-office-hours/)

### How do I change a reservation?

See [this guide](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/files/U0C72TRSM/F6QH44WCE/How_to__change__a_trip_already_associated_with_an_Authorization_in_Concur).
