## Brief overview of securing approvals

**TL;DR:** Before your trip can be approved and ticketed by the TTS Travel Team, you must ensure your travel plans have been pre-approved via [a sufficiently descriptive email]()* by [an authorizing official](). Forward this email to tts-travelauths@gsa.gov. You can then go ahead and [stamp and submit for Travel Team approval](/#submit-for-travel-team-approval).

**Note:** [Emails approvals are not needed for most training and event related-travel, including large team IRLs](/#travel-to-a-training-conference-event-or-large-team-irl). [International travel follows a different process entirely](/#international-travel). Skip ahead to [submitting for travel team approval](/#submit-for-travel-team-approval).

## How to secure authorizing official approval

You must formally request your authorizing official's approval via email.*    [Who is my authorizing official](/#who-is-my-authorizing-official-and-what-is-my-budget)

*Note that in many cases, your engagement manager or team lead may request approval on behalf of the group-- reach out to them before emailing your authorizing official.

The body of the email must include the following:     [See an individual template here](/#individual-travel) [and a group template here](/#group-travel)

* Names of individuals traveling    [What if this changes?](/#what-if-who-is-traveling-changes)
* Start and end dates of travel    [What if I am extending travel for personal reasons?](/#what-if-I-am-extending-travel-for-personal-reasons)
* A brief description of work to be done on the trip
* Identified budget that will be paying for the trip    [How do I identify my budget?](/#who-is-my-authorizing-official-and-what-is-my-budget)
* Origin and destinations for each individual    [What if I am traveling to or returning from a location other than my home location?](/#What-if-I-am-traveling-to-or-returning-from-a-location-other-than-my-home-location)
* Estimated expenses for each individual    [How should I estimate my expenses?](/#How-should-I-estimate-my-expenses)

#### Who is my authorizing official and what is my budget?

Your authorizing official must be a supervisor or director at GSA. 

If your travel is **nonbillable**, and coming from your team's budget, your authorizing official would be your supervisor or director. If expenses will be paid out of another team's budget (list of budgets available in cell C5 of [this sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1twEX5wrriQ3Tbn25wN4n8rZPF9h5NqRQWIskkW6xQpY/edit#gid=0)), you will need a supervisor or director from that team to approve.

If your travel is **billable** you will need to get approval from the director of the team who oversees the type of project you are working on:

* 18F Custom Partner Solutions: Alex Bisker
* 10x : Nico Papafil
* cloud.gov: Carlo Costino
* login.gov: Alex Dalessio
* Centers of Excellence: Bob DeLuca or Brian Whittaker

#### What if who is traveling changes?

A follow-up to the original email from the authorizing official indicating who the new travel is, and if there is any change in dates or estimated cost is sufficient.

#### What if I am extending travel for personal reasons?

Include language that specifies which days will be at your own expense, and acknowledge that "I understand all other travel expenses including lodging and meals before or after the official travel dates specified above are my own responsibility."

#### What if I am traveling to or returning from a location other than my home location?

If you were previously scheduled to be on leave or telework at the other location*, the full cost of travel from or to that location can be approved at the discretion of your authorizing official. Ensure that there is language in the email that reflects your itinerary.

If you'd like to schedule personal travel that's incidental to your work trip (i.e. planned after the work trip), after your official work itinerary has been approved in Concur, you can give AdTrav a call at (877) 472-6716 and request that your itinerary be changed, with you covering any difference in cost that may arise.

*Note that while GSA travel policy doesn't explicitly forbid being approved to travel from a foreign location, [travel to or from foreign locations](/#international-travel) must be requested in Event Tracker for GSA Administrator approval at least 7 weeks in advance, amking approval in these circumstances extremely unlikely.

#### International travel

All official international travel taken by GSA employees, regardless of funding source, also requires Salesforce event approval. Please reach out to michael.proul@gsa.gov at least 7 weeks in advance in order to coordinate this.

#### How should I estimate my expenses

In the case of individual or small group travel, you may estimate your expenses based on the total amount of your authorization in Concur, plus an reasonable allowance for any additional expenses such as taxis, parking, and baggage fees.

For larger group travel, it is recommended to use this [travel expenses estimator template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uJaGMXJOwURruaPdV7PU5B7Q22_iyF8Q2Gk2uamDG8Y/edit#gid=0) which automatically calculates most airfare and per diems.

  * [What if, for personal reasons,  I want to extend my travel beyond my work dates (i.e. stay in DC for the weekend)?](/travel-guide-faq/#extend-travel)

  * [What if I am traveling from or to another city that is not my home city?](/travel-guide-faq/#multi-city)

#### Travel to a training, conference, event, or large team IRL

Travel pre-approval is secured via the [event request process](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeQHPIOtNwzEA7IxrJ4JDHeEUrWNUsiEkbnp8lK26jX04PYBg/viewform), so you can skip to the [next step](), unless you will be [extending your trip at your own expense](), [flying to or from points that are not either your duty station or location of the event](), or combining your event travel with travel for some other reason.

#### Amending or updating approval for travel

Certain deviations from your original itinerary will require re-approval from your supervisor or client as appropriate-- consult [the appendix on amended authorizations](/travel-guide-A-amended-authorizations) for more details.

#### Notice about late approvals

Ensure that you request your approval with sufficient advance notice. Requests made late may not receive director or client approval in time. Requests that are not finalized before 4:30 PM Eastern time the last business day before travel begins will not be approved by the Travel Team. If an urgent need to travel arises after this time, you will need to work with your authorizing official and AdTrav (gvtagents@adtrav.com) to complete the GSA Form 87. More details about this process can be found [here](travel-guide-B-after-hours-emergency-travel-authorizations).

## Make Your Authorization or Voucher is Ready to Submit
[This Checklist](https://goo.gl/AWbT7Q) will help you check your authorization/voucher for potential issues that can result in your request getting rejected or returned for correction.

## Submit for Travel Team Approval

**The last step, AKA the Stamp and Submit dance**

1. Click **Document Actions -> Submit Document** (in the upper right hand corner of your authorization)

2. You will be taken to a document history page. If your **“Status to Apply”** is **“Submit to Approver”**, then click **Stamp and Submit Document** at either the top or the bottom of the page and continue. If not, please correct any other failures.

3. The next page will show you your **pre-audit results**. These will let you know if anything might be awry, which is represented by either a _FAIL_ or a _HARDFAIL_. As long as you've followed the process up to here correctly, you shouldn't worry too much about either _FAILS_ or _HARDFAILS_. Here's what to do if you get them:

    * Any _HARDFAIL_ must be corrected before the submission of the authorization. Likely causes for _HARDFAILS_ are the lack of accounting codes, which can be looked up [here](https://goo.gl/4WkMqM). If you're not sure that you've used the correct codes or you're still getting a _HARDFAIL_, please ensure that [the information in the General tab](/travel-guide-3-approval/#fill-in-general-information) is correct and then close out of your authorization (click **Close Document** to the left of the *Document Actions* button).  Notify the travel team in #travel or at tts-travel@gsa.gov and they will assist you during their next [office hours](/travel-101/#communication).

    *  _FAILS_ can happen for a variety of reasons. TTS's travel process is designed so you don't have to worry about Concur _FAILS_-- as long as you've followed all of the rules up to here, the travel team will look into and justify anything that needs clarification. Proceed to **Continue Stamping the Document**

4. If you had no _HARDFAILS_ and successfully stamped the document, you be taken to a page with the button **Close Post Stamping Document Closure Screen**. It doesn’t look like it, but when you see that button, you are done! Your authorization has been submitted. You don’t even have to click the button again (but you can if you want).

If there was a problem, the TTS travel team will reach out and make sure you can get everything right before you leave. Otherwise, assume your request will be processed, and if everything was right, you will be approved between 2:30 and 6:00 PM Eastern time. **Please ensure that you have submitted your authorization correctly by 2:30 PM Eastern, else your travel will not be approved until the next business day.**

Once you have been approved, you should recieve a notification from Concur. Please note that in most cases, **government contract airfare does not ticket until 72 hours before departure**, so you may not recieve official confirmation of your itinerary until then. Don't worry about this, the TTS travel team is not aware of any situations where approved travelers have not been issued tickets :)
