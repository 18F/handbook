Now that you've booked your travel, to ensure the reservations you made can be approved and ticketed. There are 3 main parts to this process:

1. [Completing your Trip Information](#complete-trip-information)

2. [Securing and attaching supervisor approval](/#secure-and-attach-supervisor-approval)

3. [Submitting your Authorization for Travel Team approval](#submit-authorization-for-approval)

## Complete Trip Information
On the **Trip Booking Information** page you must enter some general information in order to ensure that your trip gets billed to the right client and/or budget.

If you called Ad Trav to book travel, you'll need to open [Concur](https://travel.gsa.gov) no sooner than an hour after your initial call to AdTrav, going to the **Authorizations** tab, clicking on your authorization, and selecting **Edit Authorization**. This will open up the document, where you can go to the **General** tab and see the fields that are presented below:

Enter the following trip information on this page:
<img src="/images/travel/12-trip-name.png" class="travel-guide-hide" alt="Trip Booking Information screen">

**Trip name:** Identify the budget of your trip here, based on the type of project you are traveling for:

_Billable projects:_ for 18F and CoE, include the exact name and number of the project as it appears in [Tock](tock.18f.gov/projects). For PIF billable travel, simply indicate the project is billable
_All other projects:_ include the name of the team budget that is paying for this travel (a list of options is in cell C5 of the [TTS Budget and Accounting Lookup](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1twEX5wrriQ3Tbn25wN4n8rZPF9h5NqRQWIskkW6xQpY/edit#gid=0)

If you are traveling for multiple projects (whether billable or not), list all of the relevant Tock name and numbers and budget names as appropriate.

Examples: 
`BILLABLE: 18F / HHS / CMS FY19 #997`
`BILLABLE: CoE / USDA Phase 2 / Cloud Adoption #980`
`BILLABLE: PIF - DHS`
`NONBILLABLE: OPP Smarter IT Solutions Division (QXD)`
`NONBILLABLE: 18F Strategy Branch (QEAD)`
`NONBILLABLE: Cloud Adoption CoE`
    
**Type Code:** "SINGLE TRIP".
**Trip Purpose:** “Mission (Operational)” in most cases, unless attending a conference or training.
**Document detail:** Brief summary of the purpose of the trip.
**Will this travel be a detail to another location?** No.

Proceed by clicking **Next** to finalize the reservation.

You will now see final reservation. Review all of the details and hit **“Confirm booking”** when done.

#### Additional step if you booked your hotel outside of Concur or Ad Trav
**Note** If you did not book a hotel from Concur, a policy violation will be flagged. If this applies to you, [briefly justify why your hotel choice](/travel-guide-1-book-travel/#can-i-book-outside-of-concur).

## Securing supervisor approval

Before your trip can be approved and ticketed by the TTS Travel Team, you must ensure your travel plans have been pre-approved by someone who has the ability to obligate funds on behalf of the government. Who this person is and how you secure their approval depends on the purpose of travel.

#### Travel to a training, conference, event, or large team IRL

Travel pre-approval is secured via the [event request process](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeQHPIOtNwzEA7IxrJ4JDHeEUrWNUsiEkbnp8lK26jX04PYBg/viewform), so you can skip to the [next step](), unless you will be [extending your trip at your own expense](), [flying to or from points that are not either your duty station or location of the event](), or combining your event travel with travel for some other reason.

#### Travel for a billable project

You must secure an email 

## Make Your Authorization or Voucher is Ready to Submit
[This Checklist](https://goo.gl/AWbT7Q) will help you check your authorization/voucher for potential issues that can result in your request getting rejected or returned for correction.

## Submit Authorization for Approval
You're getting really close! You can almost feel the TSA X-ray scan! One last step before it's travel time! In this step, you will send your authorization to be approved by the TTS travel team.

1. Click **Document Actions -> Submit Document** (in the upper right hand corner of your authorization)

2. You will be taken to a document history page. If your **“Status to Apply”** is **“Submit to Approver”**, then click **Stamp and Submit Document** at either the top or the bottom of the page and continue. If not, please correct any other failures.

3. The next page will show you your **pre-audit results**. These will let you know if anything might be awry, which is represented by either a _FAIL_ or a _HARDFAIL_. As long as you've followed the process up to here correctly, you shouldn't worry too much about either _FAILS_ or _HARDFAILS_. Here's what to do if you get them:

    * Any _HARDFAIL_ must be corrected before the submission of the authorization. Likely causes for _HARDFAILS_ are the lack of accounting codes, which can be looked up [here](https://goo.gl/4WkMqM). If you're not sure that you've used the correct codes or you're still getting a _HARDFAIL_, please ensure that [the information in the General tab](/travel-guide-3-approval/#fill-in-general-information) is correct and then close out of your authorization (click **Close Document** to the left of the *Document Actions* button).  Notify the travel team in #travel or at tts-travel@gsa.gov and they will assist you during their next [office hours](/travel-101/#communication).

    *  _FAILS_ can happen for a variety of reasons. TTS's travel process is designed so you don't have to worry about Concur _FAILS_-- as long as you've followed all of the rules up to here, the travel team will look into and justify anything that needs clarification. Proceed to **Continue Stamping the Document**

4. If you had no _HARDFAILS_ and successfully stamped the document, you be taken to a page with the button **Close Post Stamping Document Closure Screen**. It doesn’t look like it, but when you see that button, you are done! Your authorization has been submitted. You don’t even have to click the button again (but you can if you want).

If there was a problem, the TTS travel team will reach out and make sure you can get everything right before you leave. Otherwise, assume your request will be processed, and if everything was right, you will be approved between 2:30 and 6:00 PM Eastern time. **Please ensure that you have submitted your authorization correctly by 2:30 PM Eastern, else your travel will not be approved until the next business day.**

Once you have been approved, you should recieve a notification from Concur. Please note that in most cases, **government contract airfare does not ticket until 72 hours before departure**, so you may not recieve official confirmation of your itinerary until then. Don't worry about this, the TTS travel team is not aware of any situations where approved travelers have not been issued tickets :)

#### Whooo you are ready to go!
