A GSA travel card will help you pay for lodging, taxis, and other miscellaneous expenses while on your trip.

While new employees may travel without one, it is required that everyone at 18F has one as soon as possible.

### 1. Complete card training

_Est. time: 60 minutes_

1. Head over to GSA's [OLU](https://gsaolu.gsa.gov).
2. Click on the Home button, and then choose "Learning" from the dropdown.
3. Below, look for a "Find Learning" search box.
4. Search for "travel card".

8. Once completed, download your certificates of completion for both trainings by returning to the "Learning" page and clicking on the "View All" button under "Learning History". You should see your completed travel card and TDY trainings on the list, and there will be an icon to generate a print preview, which you can save, at the right.
