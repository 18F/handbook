A GSA travel card will help you pay for lodging, taxis, and other miscellaneous expenses while on your trip.

While new employees may travel without one, it is required that everyone at 18F has one as soon as possible.

### 1. Complete card training

_Est. time: 60 minutes_

1. Head over to GSA's [OLU](https://gsaolu.gsa.gov).
2. Click on the Home button, and then choose "Learning" from the dropdown.
3. Below, look for a "Find Learning" search box.
4. Search for "travel training".
5. Select "Temporary Duty (TDY) Travel Training", and then Start course.
6. Once completed there is a second training to take. Return to the "Find Learning" search box and search for "travel card".
7. Select "GSA Travel Card Training", and then Start course.
8. Once completed, download your certificates of completion for both trainings by returning to the "Learning" page and clicking on the "View All" button under "Learning History". You should see your completed travel card and TDY trainings on the list, and there will be an icon to generate a print preview, which you can save, at the right.
9. For ease of processing later on, save your certificates as “Your Name travel card training” and “Your Name TDY training”.

### 2. Fill out the Supervisory Travel Card Approval

_Estimated time: 10 minutes plus wait time for your supervisor’s signature_

### 3. Send both of the training certificates and the travel card approval form as attachments to [ronnail.rawls@gsa.gov](mailto:ronnail.rawls@gsa.gov)

This may take 1-2 business days.

Once you’ve gotten the go-ahead, you’ll receive two emails, one with a link to fill out a US Bank signup form and the second with an access code which will be required to see the form. Follow the instructions attached with the email. Use your **home** address, not your office address. Ronnail and her team can assist with any questions, the TTS travel team isn't involved in this process.
