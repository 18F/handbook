In order to get access to concur, you need to obtain a vendor id. The process varies a bit depending on if you have access to GSA's online learning platform OLU.

Have you completed your Mandatory Cyber Security and Privacy Training in [OLU](https://gsaolu.gsa.gov/) yet?

[Yes - I have taken the OLU class. ](/first-time-travel-get-in-concur-post-olu)
