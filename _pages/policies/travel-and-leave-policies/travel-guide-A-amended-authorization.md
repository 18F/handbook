Sometimes, travel plans change. Fortunately, Concur, AdTrav, your carriers, and the TTS travel team are ready for that! How changes can be accommodated depends on when and how the changes occurred. But first things first-- what needs to be approved, and what doesn't need to be approved, and how?

###What kind of approvals do I need in order to change my itinerary?

No additional approval is required for changes that either shorten a trip, or for same-day changes to flights at no additional expense to the government.

Additional approval, from either a client (if billable) or director (if nonbillable) must be secured for any change to an itinerary that would increase the overall cost of the trip beyond the budgeted amount, or beyond the authorized days of travel. This includes extensions of travel made at personal expense. The approval must be sent to tts-travelauths@gsa.gov before these changes are approved in Concur.

####Delayed and cancelled flights

Approval is also required for weather-related and other delays and cancellations, however, it can be requested after your return. If you have an unexpected cancellation, your first option is to take the next trip offered by the carrier. However, if the carrier's schedule does not permit you to arrive in a reasonable amount of time but another carrier offers a significantly better option, you may change your reservation via AdTrav at (877) 472-6716. Keep records of any difference in price.

###My change has been approved (or no approval was required in the first place). Now what do I do?

If you are amending your trip before your flight has been ticketed (~72 hours before departure on government contract flights), you can simply go to your Concur homepage and locate your itinerary, which should be the very first trip you see below in the "RECENT TRIPS" section. Once you open this link, you should see all of the parts of your itinerary listed below, with options to change flights and hotels directly in Concur.

If your flight has already been ticketed, whether you have not left yet, or are already traveling and need to make a change to your return leg, you have two different options:

If you booked a fully refundable, government contract flight, it's easiest to change your travel plans by calling the airline and asking to speak with their government travel team.

If the options the airline offers won't work with your schedule, or your original flight was NOT a fully refundable government contract flight, you may call AdTrav at (877) 472-6716. Keep in mind that in addition to the $35 fee for using AdTrav, flights available on other airlines may be more expensive and could strain your project or unit's budget.

Whether calling the airline direct, or calling AdTrav, keep records of any difference in price so the travel can be accounted for correctly after you return.

If your travel requires a change in dates, but no flight or rail reservations will be affected, skip ahead to the [Manually amending dates of travel in Concur](#manually-amending-dates-of-travel-in-concur) section.

####Changes required in Concur

Once you go through the process of making the changes to your itinerary, there are two possible outcomes:

1. If the changes you are making to your trip *do not* require additional approval as per the guidance above, once you confirm your reservation, assuming your trip had previously been approved in Concur, no further action is required-- safe travels!

2. If the changes you are making to your trip *do* require additional approvals, your new reservations will be considered to be an **Amendment** to the authorization, and will need to be [re-submitted for approval again]({{site.baseurl}}/travel-guide-3-approval). The travel team will approve when the email of approval is received in the [tts-travelauths@gsa.gov](mailto:tts-travelauths@gsa.gov) box.

In the case of travel that is already in progress, no amendment may be immediately required to take a flight in some cases. However, before doing your voucher, you will have to submit an amended authorization, which will be automatically generated for you in you booked via AdTrav. If you called the airline to change your reservations, you will likely need to manually amend your dates of travel in Concur.

###Manually amending dates of travel in Concur

In cases of travel where the new dates of travel are entirely within the originally approved dates, this sort of modification can be done directly in the voucher. When dates need to be extended for any reason, the extension must be requested via an amended authorization. For either situation, the tab where these edits are made in Concur is the same-- both will be in the **General** tab, in the **Travel Dates** section at the very bottom. Travel dates may be adjusted accordingly, and additional destinations can be added in the **Itinerary Locations** section directly above. When dates are finalized, the amended authorization or voucher may be submitted for Concur approval as normal.

An amended authorization may be created by navigating to the **Authorizations** tab, selecting the authorization in need of change, selecting **Amend authorization** from the list of options, and then creating the amendment.

The process for creating a voucher is detailed [here]({{site.baseurl}}/travel-guide-5-reimbursement).
