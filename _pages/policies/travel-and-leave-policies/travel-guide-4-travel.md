Travel _and keep receipts!_

Now for the fun part! Here are a few things to keep in mind when traveling for TTS.

### Use your travel card and keep all receipts!

Use of the GSA travel card is mandatory for all expenses as per the [Federal Travel Regulation](https://www.gsa.gov/policy-regulations/regulations/federal-travel-regulation-ftr?asset=101276#wp1091086), except expenses for which it "is impractical (e.g., vendor does not accept credit cards) or imposes unreasonable burdens or costs (e.g., fees are charged for using the card)."

Additionally, you should keep receipts for as many expenses as practicable (except meals), **including taxis of all amounts**. Only travel booked in Concur, meals/incidentals, public transit, parking, and tolls under $25 are exempt from receipt requirements. TTS' practices in this regard are stricter than GSA as a whole due to the fact that many TTS clients may have more exhaustive receipt requirements than GSA; sometimes we need to provide these receipts to them in order to be reimbursed.

### Receipt guidelines for specific expenses

* Hotels: a receipt including a full breakout of nightly rate and lodging tax where applicable is required.

* Taxis (including Uber, Lyft, and other rideshare services): receipts for taxis, regardless of amount, are required.

* Public transportation: receipts for all public transit expenses are preferred, however receipts for expenses over $25 are required.

* Parking: receipts for all parking are preferred, however receipts for all parking over $25 are required.

* Checked baggage: receipts for all baggage charges are required.

* Internet: receipts for all internet-related expenses are required. Hotel wifi is generally non-reimbursable given that GSA pays for data plans that should offer a connection of sufficient strength, extensive justification is required for any wifi purchased outside of air travel.

* Tolls: receipts for all tolls over $25 are required. For tolls under that amount, attaching a map of your itinerary indicating that payment of tolls was required is sufficient.

* Rental cars and associated fuel expenses: Receipts are required for all rental cars and associated fuel charges. Note that fuel is only directly reimbursable for rental cars-- personal vehicle use is instead subject to mileage reimbursement rates, and fuel for GSA fleet vehicles is paid for via a GSA fleet card.

#### Meals and Incidental Expenses (M&IE)

In addition to receiving round trip tickets to your destination and lodging for the nights that you need to stay there, you also get a flat-rate per diem for **Meals and Incidental Expenses (M&IE)**. A few things to remember:

* M&IE is given to you to cover the additional expenses you might incur while traveling that you might not normally have at home, like dining out instead of eating home-cooked meals, forgetting toothpaste, tipping hotel porters, etc.

* This allowance is at your discretion to spend and **you don’t need to provide receipts** for it.

* The amount that is given is based on your location, not your actual expenses.

    * For example, M&IE is $69 per day in Washington DC but only $56 per day in Atlanta.

    * If you only spent $50 on M&IE per day while you were in DC, you would keep the rest. Conversely, if you spent $90 per day, you would pay the difference.

* M&IE is given at a reduced rate on “travel days”-- i.e. days where part of the normal work day was spent traveling.

* M&IE is given as a reimbursement after submitting a voucher, which is done after you return from a trip.

* You may use either the travel card or your personal card for your meals and incidental expenses.

    * If you do pay for M&IE on the Travel Card, you will have to pay off the remaining balance on the card at the end of the month youself-- ostensibly using the flat M&IE reimbursement that the government will credit to your personal account after you submit your voucher.

### Don't forget about vouchers!

Have a good trip, [get reimbursement]({{site.baseurl}}/travel-guide-5-reimbursement)-- filling out a voucher-- within a 5 business days of getting back.

Why the rush? Filling out a voucher correctly allows you to:

1. Get reimbursed for your M&IE and for any hotels, airplane tickets, or other expenses you paid for personally.

2. Have the government automatically pay off the balance on your Travel Card. If you do your voucher correctly and on time, you will never have to worry about paying one of those bills yourself.

On the other side, when travel expenses are submitted late, it’s a major drain on resources for the finance and agreements teams, which sometimes have to reopen billing and even modify agreements in order to recover our costs for the trip, which the Economy Act requires us to do. So, **no travel will be approved for anyone with travel expenses that are more than 5 business days outstanding.**
