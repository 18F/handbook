Travel _and keep receipts!_

Now for the fun part! Here are a few things to keep in mind when traveling for TTS.

### Meals and Incidental Expenses (M&IE)

In addition to receiving round trip tickets to your destination and lodging for the nights that you need to stay there, you also get a flat-rate per diem for **Meals and Incidental Expenses (M&IE)**. A few things to remember:

* M&IE is given to you to cover the additional expenses you might incur while traveling that you might not normally have at home, like dining out instead of eating home-cooked meals, forgetting toothpaste, tipping hotel porters, etc.

* This allowance is at your discretion to spend and **you don’t need to provide receipts** for it.

* M&IE is given as a reimbursement after submitting a voucher, which is done after you return from a trip.

* Because you don’t need to provide receipts for it, it’s recommended that you **not use the travel card for meals or incidental expenses.** It’s just easier to use personal money for this.

    * If you do pay for M&IE on the Travel Card, you will have to pay off the remaining balance on the card at the end of the month youself-- ostensibly using the flat M&IE reimbursement that the government will credit to your personal account after you submit your voucher.

* The amount that is given is based on your location, not your actual expenses.

    * For example, M&IE is $71 per day in Washington DC but only $56 per day in Atlanta.

    * If you only spent $50 on M&IE per day while you were in DC, you would keep the rest. Conversely, if you spent $90 per day, you would pay the difference.

* M&IE is given at a reduced rate on “travel days”-- i.e. days where part of the normal work day was spent traveling.

### What to put on your travel card
Here are a few expenses that you should put on the travel card (and **keep receipts** for):

* Hotels

* Taxis

* Public transportation

* Parking

* Mileage reimbursement when using a personal vehicle (if determined advantageous to the Government)

### Don't forget about vouchers!

Have a good trip, [get reimbursement](/travel-guide-5-reimbursement)-- filling out a voucher-- within a 5 business days of getting back.

Why the rush? Filling out a voucher correctly allows you to:

1. Get reimbursed for your M&IE and for any hotels, airplane tickets, or other expenses you paid for personally.

2. Have the government automatically pay off the balance on your Travel Card. If you do your voucher correctly and on time, you will never have to worry about paying one of those bills yourself.

On the other side, when travel expenses are submitted late, it’s a major drain on resources for the finance and agreements teams, which sometimes have to reopen billing and even modify agreements in order to recover our costs for the trip, which the Economy Act requires us to do. So, **no travel will be approved for anyone with travel expenses that are more than 5 business days outstanding.**
