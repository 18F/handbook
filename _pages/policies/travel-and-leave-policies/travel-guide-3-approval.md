Now that you've chosen your itinerary, its time to complete some additional trip information to get your trip ready for approval and to book your tickets. There are 2 main parts to this process:

1. [Completing your Trip Information](#complete-trip-information)

2. [Submit your Authorization for Approval](#submit-authorization-for-approval)

## Complete Trip Information
On the **Trip Booking Information** page you must enter some general information in order to ensure that your trip gets billed to the right client and/or budget.

If you called Ad Trav to choose your itinerary, you can follow these instructions towards getting Concur approval by opening it up [Concur](https://travel.gsa.gov), going to the **Authorizations** tab, clicking on your authorization, and selecting **Edit Authorization**. This will open up the document, where you can go to the **General** tab and see the fields that are presented below:

Enter the following trip information on this page:

1. **Trip name:** Follow the naming convention below:

    * BILLABLE/NON-BILLABLE: [Exact name of Tock Project] you are billing against, # of [tock project ID](http://tock.18f.gov/projects).

    * Example: NON-BILLABLE: Ops/ Admin #3

2. **Document detail:** Brief summary of the purpose of the trip.

3. **Will this travel be a detail to another location?** No.

4. **Trip Purpose:** “Mission (Operational)” in most cases, but occasionally “Conference” or “Training”.

Proceed by clicking **Next** to finalize the reservation.

You will now see final reservation. Review all of the details and hit **“Confirm booking”** when done.

#### Additional step if you booked your hotel outside of Concur or Ad Trav
**Note** If you did not book a hotel from Concur, please briefly justify why you are not using a hotel.

### Fill in general information

1. Click on the **General** tab of your authorization.
1. Select the **Document Information** tab.
1. For **Type Code**, select "SINGLE TRIP".
1. Click **Save**.

[Proceed to Submit Authorization for Approval](/travel-guide-3-approval/#submit-authorization-for-approval)

#### Having Trouble
**What is an authorization?** Steps 1-3 cover the process of getting an authorization, which is simply the formal approval from your supervisor for travel, including a review and booking of major expenses such as flights and hotels.

If you've navigated away from your authorization, you can find it from the **Home** page, scroll down to the **Recent Authorization** and click **Edit**

## Make Your Authorization or Voucher is Ready to Submit
[This Checklist](https://goo.gl/AWbT7Q) will help you check your authorization/voucher for potential issues that can result in your request getting rejected or returned for correction. 

## Submit Authorization for Approval
You're getting really close! You can almost feel the TSA X-ray scan! One last step before it's travel time! In this step, you will send your authorization to be approved by the TTS travel team.

1. Click **Document Actions -> Submit Document** (in the upper right hand corner of your authorization)

2. You will be taken to a document history page. If your **“Status to Apply”** is **“Submit to Approver”**, then click **Stamp and Submit Document** at either the top or the bottom of the page and continue. If not, please correct any other failures.

3. The next page will show you your **pre-audit results**. These will let you know if anything might be awry, which is represented by either a _FAIL_ or a _HARDFAIL_. As long as you've followed the process up to here correctly, you shouldn't worry too much about either _FAILS_ or _HARDFAILS_. Here's what to do if you get them:

    * Any _HARDFAIL_ must be corrected before the submission of the authorization. Likely causes for _HARDFAILS_ are the lack of accounting codes, which only the TTS travel team has to worry about (you don't). Please first ensure that [the information in the General tab](/travel-guide-3-approval/#fill-in-general-information) is correct, then close out of your authorization (click **Close Document** to the left of the *Document Actions* button), and finally notify the travel team in #travel or at 18f-travel@gsa.gov and they will assist you during their next [office hours](/travel-101/#communication).

    *  _FAILS_ can happen for a variety of reasons. TTS's travel process is designed so you don't have to worry about Concur _FAILS_-- as long as you've followed all of the rules up to here, the travel team will look into and justify anything that needs clarification. Proceed to **Continue Stamping the Document**

4. If you had no _HARDFAILS_ and successfully stamped the document, you be taken to a page with the button **Close Post Stamping Document Closure Screen**. It doesn’t look like it, but when you see that button, you are done! Your authorization has been submitted. You don’t even have to click the button again (but you can if you want).

If there was a problem, the TTS travel team will reach out and make sure you can get everything right before you leave. Otherwise, assume your request will be processed, and if everything was right, you will be approved between 2:30 and 6:00 PM Eastern time. **Please ensure that you have submitted your authorization correctly by 2:30 PM Eastern, else your travel will not be approved until the next business day.**

Once you have been approved, you should recieve a notification from Concur. Please note that in most cases, **government contract airfare does not ticket until 72 hours before departure**, so you may not recieve official confirmation of your itinerary until then. Don't worry about this, the TTS travel team is not aware of any situations where approved travelers have not been issued tickets :)

#### Whooo you are ready to go!
