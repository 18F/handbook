In order to travel for TTS, you need to go through three steps to ensure that your plans get fully approved and ticketed. Here's the TL;DR for each one:

1. [Confirm email of approval:](/travel-guide-1-authorization/#confirm-your-travel-dates-and-get-an-email-of-approval) ensuring that your travel plans are pre-approved via email by someone who has the ability to obligate funds on behalf of the government, and that this approval is communicated to the TTS travel team by sending it to [18ftravelauths@gsa.gov](mailto:18ftravelauths@gsa.gov).
2. [Choose your itinerary:](/travel-guide-2-choose-your-itinerary) the process of making reservations in Concur, the E-Gov travel system. Reservations in Concur are called **Authorizations**.
3. [Submit for Concur approval:](/travel-guide-3-approval) ensuring that the TTS travel team receives your authorization and has the necessary details to formally approve your travel. The travel team reviews and approves authorization each day at 2:30 PM Eastern time, so please ensure that it is in by that time to allow for same-day review.

Starting this process assumes that you are both in the Concur system and have a GSA travel card. If you're not sure if you've completed these necessary pre-steps, please check out the [First-Time Travel Guide](/first-time-travel-concur-check) or read on more below:

* [Get in Concur](/first-time-travel-get-in-concur-start)

* [Get a GSA travel card](/first-time-travel-travel-card)

* [Add your travel card and travel preferences to Concur](/first-time-travel-complete-concur-profile)

## Confirm your travel dates and get an email of approval

Before making *any* reservations, you'll want to make sure that your trip has been pre-approved by someone who has the ability to obligate funds on behalf of the government. This person could be someone inside TTS (either the director of a division, chapter or business unit) if the travel is considered non-billable, or they could be someone outside TTS (who is designated on an inter-agency agreement or memorandum of understanding with TTS) if the travel is considered billable. There is a slightly different process for requesting approval depending on whether the travel is [billable](/travel-guide-1-authorization/#billable-travel-approval) or [nonbillable](/travel-guide-1-authorization/#non-billable-travel-approval).

## Non-billable travel approval

### Who is responsible, and how do I make my request?

Dision and unit directors are responsible for approving non-billable travel, as they have a budget for training and travel that is set at the beginning of each fiscal year. Should you need to travel for internal TTS business, you should first clearly communicate your travel plans and what you will be working on to the director who will be approving your travel. You should make sure you communicate your plans with the approving director at least two weeks in advance, as non-billable travel expenses require additional review. **Requests for non-billable travel initiated less than seven business days in advance will not be approved.**

### Which director?

The director who should approve your travel is usually the director of your division, chapter or business unit, but that is not always the case. If, for example, you are in a chapter, but looking to travel to do business development, you will want to seek approval from the head of the line of business that most closely relates to the type of business that you are looking to develop.

### Communicating non-billable travel approval to the TTS travel team

While individual employees are responsible for providing the details required by their directors in advance of getting their travel approved, directors alone are responsible for sending the initial email of approval to [18ftravelauths@gsa.gov](mailto:18ftravelauths@gsa.gov). Their email needs to include the following:

* **In the subject line:** [NON-BILLABLE] - [Tock Project Name] - #[Tock Project ID] -- [Official Travel Start Date] - [Official Travel End Date]
* **In the cc line:** All individuals approved for travel should be cc'd when the email is forwarded to [18ftravelauths@gsa.gov](mailto:18ftravelauths@gsa.gov).
* **In the body:** Names, origins, and destinations, as well as dates/locations of any additional travel made in conjunction with official travel at the individual's personal expense.
* **As an attachment** An estimate of total travel expenses using either this [individual](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uJaGMXJOwURruaPdV7PU5B7Q22_iyF8Q2Gk2uamDG8Y/edit#gid=0) or [group](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uJaGMXJOwURruaPdV7PU5B7Q22_iyF8Q2Gk2uamDG8Y/edit#gid=1000729692) template. Other formats are allowed provided they include the same general information. Flight estimates must be based on [round-trip City Pair fares](http://cpsearch.fas.gsa.gov/cpsearch/search.do?method=enter) (use 2x the value of Govt YCA fare), hotel/M&IE estimates must be based on the [GSA per diem rates](http://www.gsa.gov/portal/category/100120), and mileage cost estimates must be based on [GSA Reimbursement rates](http://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/100715).

Once you have been cc'd on your director's email of approval, you are good to move on to [the next step](/travel-guide-1-authorization/#Im-approved-Whats-next). Below are just a few more items that your director will need to consider when approving your travel.

#### Group approvals for non-billable travel

If two or more 18F staff are traveling to the same activity, the approval must be done together. It is the responsibility of unit directors to ensure all travelers are accounted for in their approval request. Unit directors should coordinate with one another to ensure all units who have staff traveling are represented in the request, whether it is via C2 for trainings/conferences, or via email to 18ftravelauths@gsa.gov for other types of non-billable travel.

#### Travel to trainings and conferences requested in C2

No email to 18ftravelauths@gsa.gov is required for travel to trainings and conferences requested in [C2](https://requests.18f.gov). Any amendments to travel dates may be requested via comment in the C2 system.

#### Deadline for approving non-billable travel
Unit directors must send their emails of approval to [18ftravelauths@gsa.gov](mailto:18ftravelauths@gsa.gov) before 12:30 PM Eastern on Wednesday in order for the request to be approved by in Concur by Friday. Approvals that arrive late will not be considered until the following Wednesday.

#### Amending approval for non-billable travel
Any amendment to approved non-billable travel that would require an additional day of per diem or lodging, exceeding the government maximum hotel rate, or otherwise exceeding the original approved estimate by more than 20% must be re-approved by the unit director and sent to [18ftravelauths@gsa.gov](mailto:18ftravelauths@gsa.gov) for further review by Wednesday at 12:30 PM Eastern.

Any other amendment with a minimal impact on the budget (i.e. change of dates, adding additional days at the traveler's personal expense, changing origin or destination airports with no significant cost increase) requires only that the unit directors approve the change and communicate it to [18ftravelauths@gsa.gov](mailto:18ftravelauths@gsa.gov) before 2:30 PM Eastern to allow the travel team to approve changes in Concur that same business day.

## Billable travel approval

### Who is responsible, and how to I make my request?

Your client is responsible for providing approval for your billable travel. Your project manager (or someone they delegate) is responsible for communicating the travel request to the client and securing their approval. Once this is done, the individual who secured the client's email of approval must forward it to [18ftravelauths@gsa.gov](mailto:18ftravelauths@gsa.gov) and cc the members of the team who are traveling.

### Which client?

The client approving travel should be one of the client signatories of the IAA or MOU, or a person formally delegated by one of those individuals. If you aren't sure who this is, please ask your client partner about who is responsible for approving travel and they should point you in the right direction.

### Communicating billable travel approval to the TTS travel team

Project managers (or their delegates) are responsible for requesting written approval of travel plans to the client and once approval is secured, sending it via email to [18ftravelauths@gsa.gov](mailto:18ftravelauths@gsa.gov). Their email needs to include the following:

* **In the subject line:** [BILLABLE] - [Tock Project Name] - #[Tock Project ID] -- [Official Travel Start Date] - [Official Travel End Date]
* **In the cc line:** All individuals approved for travel should be cc'd when the email is forwarded to [18ftravelauths@gsa.gov](mailto:18ftravelauths@gsa.gov).
* **In the body:** Names, origins, and destinations, as well as dates/locations of any additional travel made in conjunction with official travel at the individual's personal expense.
* **As an attachment** An estimate of total travel expenses using either this [individual](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uJaGMXJOwURruaPdV7PU5B7Q22_iyF8Q2Gk2uamDG8Y/edit#gid=0) or [group](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uJaGMXJOwURruaPdV7PU5B7Q22_iyF8Q2Gk2uamDG8Y/edit#gid=1000729692) template. Other formats are allowed provided they include the same general information. Flight estimates must be based on [round-trip City Pair fares](http://cpsearch.fas.gsa.gov/cpsearch/search.do?method=enter) (use 2x the value of Govt YCA fare), hotel/M&IE estimates must be based on the [GSA per diem rates](http://www.gsa.gov/portal/category/100120), and mileage cost estimates must be based on [GSA Reimbursement rates](http://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/100715).

Both non-billable and billable travel emails of approval have the same requirements-- it's just that the former comes straight from a director and the latter is between the project manager and the client. Once you have been cc'd on your client's email of approval, you are good to move on to [the next step](/travel-guide-1-authorization/#Im-approved-Whats-next). Below are just a few more items that your project manager will need to consider when approving your travel.

#### Deadline for approving billable travel
This email confirming approval must be sent to [18ftravelauths@gsa.gov](mailto:18ftravelauths@gsa.gov) before 2:30 PM Eastern to receive review that business day. It is recommended that this email be sent at least 2-3 business days in advance of any travel in case there are any questions, concerns, or technical difficulties that cause delays.

#### Amending approval for billable travel
Any changes to the itinerary approved by the client that require:

* A change in dates for either business or personal reasons
* Additional days of per diem or lodging that the client will have to pay for
* Exceeding the [government maximum hotel rate](http://www.gsa.gov/portal/category/100120)
* A flight that exceeds the [City Pair rate](http://cpsearch.fas.gsa.gov/cpsearch/search.do?method=enter)
* Otherwise exceeding the original approved estimate by more than 20%

MUST be re-approved by the client.

Individual travelers or project managers with such a change to their itinerary may reach out directly to the client on the same thread as the email sent to 18ftravelauths@gsa.gov to to request approval. Client approval of the changes is due at 2:30 PM Eastern to allow the travel team to approve changes in Concur that same business day.

#### Template emails of approval

This is a basic email of approval for individual billable travel, but could also be adapted for use for a group:

---

**Subject:** [BILLABLE/NON-BILLABLE] - [Tock Project Name] - #[Tock Project ID] -- [Departure_Date] - [Return Date]

---

**Body:**
