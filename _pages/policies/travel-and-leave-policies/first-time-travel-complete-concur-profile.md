You will want to complete your Concur profile to pay for hotels listed in Concur with your Travel Card and get your preferred airline seats, miles, rewards, etc.

**Please take time to review this step if you haven’t traveled in a while.**

It will make [booking hotels in Concur]({{site.baseurl}}/how-to-book-a-hotel-in-concur) easier, and allow you to personally redeem miles and/or points earned while on government travel.

1. Log into Concur [travel.gsa.gov](http://travel.gsa.gov/).
2. In the *I want to...* menu select **Edit my profile**
3. Update your **Your Information > Personal Information**
4. If you have already received your card in the mail, add your GSA Credit card to **Your Information > Credit Cards**. **If you skipped this step because you had to travel before getting a Travel Card, return to it when your card arrives.** You’ll be glad you did.
5. _Optional_ Update your **Travel Settings > Travel Preferences** Do you prefer window seats? Have a frequent flyer or hotel points account? You get to keep those, yay!
