When you're working from an atypical location in another time zone or attending a conference, it is helpful to communicate
your location so people know what to expect in terms of timezone and availability. Consider:
- Noting your location in your Slack name and/or status (for example: `Jane Doe | WFBoston | she`).
- If you're in a full-day event or otherwise expect not to be available, mark that time on your calendar and make a note 
of it in your Slack name and/or status.
- [Optional] Some folks also create a multi-day event on their calendars to note where they are (for example, a five-day
event called "Working from Boston"). This helps your colleagues understand when to expect a response and avoids confusion.
