## Brief overview of vouchers

**TL;DR** Vouchers should be created in [Concur](travel.gsa.gov) after you return from your trip. You can get started by navigating to the **Vouchers** tab on top and selecting **New Voucher**.

Any travel that involves a flight, Amtrak, or is otherwise over 12 hours in duration is considered a **[Voucher From Authorization](#voucher-from-authorization)**. For any other reimbursement, including reimbursement of expenses unrelated to travel, such as professional liability insurance, choose the **[Local voucher](#local-and-miscellaneous-vouchers)** option.

Once the voucher is created, the next step is to enter expenses. For more specific guidance on when receipts ot other justification are required, read on more [here](#entering-expenses).

Finally, don't forget to [stamp and submit!](#submitting-voucher-for-approval) Your voucher will be reviewed in 3-5 business days, and reimbursement will be credited to your bank account and travel card 3-5 business days after approval.

BEFORE YOU BEGIN: did your dates of travel change such that they are in any way outside of the original dates of your trip? If yes, STOP, and create an [amended authorization](/travel-guide-A-amended-authorizations) for the new dates.

IF THIS IS YOUR FIRST TIME CREATING A VOUCHER: please read through this guide, but then feel free to [set up some 1-on-1 time with the travel team](https://sites.google.com/a/gsa.gov/tts-office-hours/) for a quick orientation if you need.

Confused by error messages?

Have issues with reimbursements?

#### Voucher from authorization

After selecting **Voucher from authorization**, you will be led through creating a voucher from your authorization that you got approved prior to traveling.

* Under Document Search, you’ll see a list of your “open” authorizations (i.e. your authorizations that don’t have vouchers yet).

* Hit the pencil button to select the authorization you’d like to be reimbursed for. You will be moved onto the next step, [Naming your Voucher](#naming-your-voucher) on the **Document Information** screen.

* **TIP**: If you can't figure out which authorization is your recent trip by name, look at the departure date column.
    
Once you've selected your authorization and continue, you'll be taken to the **Document Information** page. This should all be autopopulated, so unless some of the details of your trip changed, no further action is required here and you may continue on to **Create Document** and start [adding your expenses](#entering-expenses).

##### I can't find my authorization listed here

If you can't find your authorization on this list, it may be because an amended authorization was generated for you. If you changed your trip such that trip dates or locations fall outside what was originally approved, you'll need to [submit that amended auth for approval]() by going to the **Authorizations** tab, selecting the amended authorization corresponding to your trip, and going in to **Open Document**. 

However, in some cases, Concur will generate an amendement in error. If you suspect this is the case, head to the **Authorizations** tab, select the amended authorization corresponding to your trip, and **Delete Document**

#### Local and miscellaneous vouchers

Upon selecting the **Local voucher** option, you will be taken to a blank **Document Information** page. Here's what you need to include for each field:

* **Trip Name** This should follow [the same naming conventions you would use for a travel authorization](/travel-guide-1-book-travel/#complete-trip-information). Ensure you have [an email from your authorizing official](/travel-guide-2-secure-approvals/#how-to-secure-authorizing-official-approval) approving all of the expenses you'd like to claim sent to tts-travelauths@gsa.gov.

* **Type code** and **Trip purpose** If the voucher is for local travel (taxis, mileage, etc.), choose **Local travel**. For any other sort of reimbursement, choose **Misc voucher**.

* **Document detail** Enter a brief description of what the reimbursement is for here.

* Click on **Create Document**

Proceed on to [entering your expenses](#entering-expenses). Note that any local transit over $25 requires a receipt, and all expenses claimed on a miscellaneous voucher require receipts.

## Entering Expenses

Now you need to make sure each of your expenses is accounted for. This step is arguably the most important part of the “vouchering” process, and you can get started by navigating to the **Expenses & Receipts** tab of your voucher. 

##### Adding expenses

Expenses can be added by clicking the **Add expense** button either above or below. Make sure to save and click the **Add expense** button again before creating a new expense.

##### Editing expenses

Expenses can be edited by clicking the pencil button and then making changes on the right hand side. Don't forget to save any changes you make!

##### Selecting payment type

**Payment type** for expenses: Anything paid for on the travel card should be marked as **IBA**, anything paid for using cash or a personal card should be marked as **CASH**. **CBA** is only used for air and rail expenses paid through Concur directly. Make sure you correctly indicate what was paid on the travel card vs personal means of payment to avoid [issues with reimbursement](#issues-with-reimbursement).

##### Attaching receipts

You can attach receipts by clicking on the **Add receipt to lodging** button (looks like a slip of paper with a checkmark, just to the right of the pencil button for editing expenses.

##### Deleting expenses

Expenses can be deleted by clicking the checkbox next to the expense and then clicking the **Delete selected expenses** button either above or below.

#### Simple expenses

The following expenses can be entered as-is without further receipts, written justifications, or other considerations, provided that each expense is under $75:

* Airfare or Amtrak tickets booked through Concur or AdTrav
* Airplane wifi
* Fees for one checked bag per leg of itinerary
* Laundry expenses, if official travel is at least 4 nights
* Gasoline, if rental car approved
* Tolls, if government car, POV mileage or rental car is pre-approved
* [Meals and Incidental Expenses](#meals-and-incidental-expenses)

#### Expenses requiring receipts

The following expenses require receipts:

* [Hotels](#hotels)
* [Flights or Amtrak booked outside of Concur](#air-or-amtrak-outside-of-concur) (Requires additional justification and is only approved on a case-by-case basis)
* Any other expense exceeding $75, including most rental cars. (This threshold is $25 for local vouchers)
* Any expenses claimed on a miscellaneous voucher.

#### Expenses requiring justification:

The following expenses don't require receipts, but do require brief descriptions to justify claiming them: 

* [Local transportation (Metro, taxis, POV mileage, etc.)](#local-transportation)

#### Meals and Incidental Expenses

* **The allowance for Meals and Incidental Expenses (M&IE) is a flat rate given to a traveler regardless of what they actually spent.** No receipts or justification is needed to receive M&IE.

* **For example**: Consider a trip taken between 9/16 and 9/18. M&IE is $69 per day in DC, and is 75% of $69 ($51.75) on the first and last days of a trip. We see that the three days of M&IE has been added automatically.

##### Meals paid on the travel card

When meals are paid on the travel card, there are a few different ways of documenting it:

* One can create a new M&IE expense with expense method **IBA** in the amount spent on meals per day. The amount of M&IE reimbursed to your personal account will be automatically reduced accordingly (you will see negative charges appear that correspond with this). If you document all expenses correctly, your travel card bill will be paid off exactly.

* One can change the payment method of M&IE expenses to **IBA** so that all reimbursement is routed to the travel card. If the entire allowance was not used, any amount left over will show up as a positive balance. You may call the customer service number on the back of the card and request that a check be mailed for that remaining amount.

* One can leave the payment method of M&IE expenses as the default, **CASH**. After the voucher is processed, there will be an outstanding balance remaining. This will need to be paid-- call the customer service number on the back of the card for more details on making a payment.

##### Extra days at personal expense

If you were authorized to extend your trip at your own expense and need to delete M&IE, there are some special instructions that you should follow:

1. Edit your first *full* day of travel at your own expense by clicking on the pencil icon.

2. Click on the **View Per Diem Conditions**. You should see a menu expand below.

3. Choose **M&IE Override**, then **Override by amount**, and **0**.

4. Check **On leave**. Use **Other leave**, **8 hours**.

5. If you are requesting leave for multiple days, return to the top and enter in the last *full* day you are traveling at personal expense.

5. Save. Your M&IE should show as zero for the day. If it didn't work, just go ahead an add in a comment about the days you would like to zero out in the comments field, and the travel team will take that into account when they review your voucher for approval.

#### Hotels

If you booked a hotel in Concur, your actual hotel expenses should populate automatically. However, that automatic amount will often lump in the taxes, which should be considered a separate list.

First, attach your receipt to the first night of lodging only, unless you have multiple receipts. Note that Concur will flag all expenses needing receipts

Then, [correct the lodging expenses](#editing-expenses) so they reflect the actual nightly rate paid, not including taxes.

Finally, [add a new expense for lodging taxes in](#adding-expenses), keeping in mind the following:

* **Create Expenses Through:** Enter the last night you were checked into the hotel, and each night’s lodging tax will be copied through.

* **Expense Date:** The night that you checked in.

* **Expense Description:** Lodging Tax

* **Cost:** Tax per night (tax can also be reported as a lump sum, though lodging itself must be broken out per night)

* **Payment Method:** Travel card -> **IBA**, and other form of payment -> **CASH**

Don't forget to **Save!**

#### Local Transportation

For taxis, public transit, POV mileage and other forms of local transportation, you may [add the expense as normal](#adding-expenses), choosing whichever expense description reflects the nature of the method used. Choose the payment method used, and [upload a receipt](#attaching-receipts) only if the expense was greater than $75 (this threshold is $25 for local vouchers).

The one other item required for taxis or other local transportation is a brief comment describing the origin and destination of the travel (e.g. "from airport to office"). 

You can add this by clicking on **Show other details** and filling out the **Comments** section that pops up below.

For public transit, a “blanket entry” for all reasonable transportation expenses is OK. For example, an entry for $10 in transit fares, with the above comment describing all travel made would be fine.

For mileage claims over $75, instead of attaching a receipt, attach a screenshot showing a map of your itinerary with the calculated distance.

#### Air or Amtrak Outside of Concur
Any airfare or Amtrak tickets booked outside of Concur are *at your own risk* and may not be approved. If you are seeking reimbursement for personally booked airfare or Amtrak, you must choose **Other - Miscellaneous** as the expense description, and in the comments section under **Show other details**, you must provide a justification as to why it was not possible for you to book your travel via Concur or AdTrav.

## Submitting Voucher for Approval
Routing a voucher is now exactly the same as submitting an authorization as seen in when we [submitted our authorization for approval](/travel-guide-3-approval/#submit-authorization-for-approval). First, navigate to the **Perform Pre-Audits** Tab for your voucher.

You will now see a list of all the items that might cause a fail or hardfail for the voucher. Here are a few common ones, and here's how to address them:

#### Pre-audit fails

* **EXPENSE $ VARIANCE** or **EXPENSE % VARIANCE**

* Any _HARDFAIL_ must be corrected before the submission of the authorization-- i.e. accounting codes must be added. Likely causes for _HARDFAILS_ are the lack of accounting codes. You can try to fix this yourself-- accounting may be added in the **Accounting** tab in Concur, and you can look up your accounting code [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1twEX5wrriQ3Tbn25wN4n8rZPF9h5NqRQWIskkW6xQpY/edit#gid=0). But you can also 

*  Likely _FAILS_ arise when non-government contract flight was selected in [Choosing a flight 2](/travel-guide-2-choose-your-itinerary/#choose-a-flight) or if your booked a hotel outside of Concur. An authorization with a _FAIL_ may still be submitted, but should be justified in some way. For example, the choice of flight may be justified if there were no government contract flights available or if a non-contract fare was less expensive.

3. Correct or justify failures. To justify a _FAIL_, you may add an explanation after clicking Justify Pre-Audit Results.  If you need further assistance, please drop a message in #travel or reach out to the team via email tts-travel@gsa.gov.

4. Click **Submit** (in the upper right hand corner of your voucher)

5. Stamping
   * You will be taken to a document history page. If your **“Status to Apply”** is **“Submit to Approver”**, then click **Stamp and Submit Document** at either the top or the bottom of the page and continue. If not, please correct any other failures.

   * The next page will show you your pre-audit results again, in case you missed that step. If nothing is awry, go ahead and click **Continue Stamping the Document.**

   * It doesn’t look like it, but when you see **Close Post Stamping Document Closure Screen**, you are done!

Congrats!!! Your voucher has been submitted. You don’t even have to click the button again (but you can if you want).

## YOU'RE DONE!!!

Your voucher will be reviewed by a member of the TTS travel team within five business days. They will reach out to you via email should any corrections or clarifications be necessary.

Direct deposit was set up when you provided your banking info to the travel team when they booked your first trip (likely for your orientation at one of the GSA offices). You should see a reimbursement 3-5 business days after the voucher is approved.

#### Issues with reimbursement

##### Outstanding balance on travel card

Q: I've been sent a bill for an outstanding balance on my travel card bill. What do I do?

A: First, verify that your most recent voucher was paid to the travel card account. Go to the **Vouchers** tab of Concur, then click on the voucher number you want to view and choose **View Summary**. In the voucher view, navigate down to the **Totals and travel advances** section and verify the amount on the **Pay to Charge Card** line. This amount should match with a payment made to the travel card in your travel card statement. [[need help accessing this?]]() If it does, and there is still a remaining balance, it is likely that you used the travel card to pay for something that was either claimed as **CASH** on the voucher, or not claimed at all. 

If you discover a valid charge to your travel card that you need to be reimbursed for after your voucher is initially approved, you may create an [amended voucher](#amended-vouchers).

If you were reimbursed to your bank account for a charge made on your travel card, you will have to pay the bill for it. Contact the number on the back of your travel card for details on how payment can be made.

##### Positive balance on travel card

If you have a positive balance on the travel card, it is likely that you claimed an expense as paid for on the travel card when you actually paid for it via a personal means of payment. You can call the number on the back of your travel card and request that they mail you a check in the amount of the positive balance.

##### My reimbursement never arrived!

If it has been over a week after your voucher has been approved and your reimbursement hasn't arrived (whether to your travel card account or personal account), contact kc-travel.finance@gsa.gov and describe the issue you are having. cc tts-travel@gsa.gov.

##### Amended vouchers

To amend a voucher, go to the **Vouchers** tab of Concur, then click on the voucher number you want to view and choose **Amend voucher**. Provide a brief reason for the amendment, then proceed with [adding your revised expenses](#entering-expenses) and [resubmitting for approval](#submitting-voucher-for-approval).

**Note:** vouchers should NOT be amended in the case of revising the payment method ([IBA to CASH](#positive-balance-on-travel-card) or [vice versa](#outstanding-balance-on-travel-card)), or reducing a claim on an already-approved expense. If you were over-reimbursed for something, you will need to mail a check for that amount, made out to GSA to the following address:

USDA-OCFO
Financial Operations & Disbursement Branch
Attn:  Bryan DeLeve - 2SE
2300 Main Street
Kansas City, MO 64108

Reference the auhtorization and voucher number along with the payment.
