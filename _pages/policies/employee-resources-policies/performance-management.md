### Nominating participant reviewer(s)

This process allows supervisors and employees to [solicit feedback](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1O3G3fa2ezbz_SUqBRT3OZRt0QPrLapl6) from other supervisors or colleagues regarding their Performance Plan. HR Links allows both employees and supervisors to nominate and track participant reviews; however, only supervisors can officially submit a nomination.  If an employee nominates another employee for feedback on their performance, the nomination is submitted to the supervisor for approval.

Once nominated, participant reviewers receive a notification alerting them of the evaluation request. The employee's supervisor is required to review and approve all feedback from participant reviews. *NOTE: A participant reviewer will only be able to see the employee appraisal information that they provided.*

* Step-by-step instructions:
  * [Employee](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VxwbatliieP78-qN_VmdHxt1ROvSro4yKe9-OkjQd58/edit#heading=h.66jqk17qcdw9)

### Submitting a participant review
Submitting a participant review in HR Links is the same process for all nominated colleagues regardless of their reporting relationship to the employee.  TTS Supervisors will have to review and approve all participant reviews for their direct reports in HR Links as part of the final employee evaluation submittal process.

* Step-by-step instructions:
  * [Employee](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VxwbatliieP78-qN_VmdHxt1ROvSro4yKe9-OkjQd58/edit#heading=h.elply6roifz9)

### Establishing a performance plan for the new fiscal year
Employees have the option to update duty specific measures and/or weights -with supervisor approval- when establishing their FY20 performance plans in HR Links:

* Employee needs to review their FY19 performance plan that's been in place 120+ days and decide if/how they want to update measures and category weights
* During 1:1 performance review session (in addition to finalizing the FY19 performance review):
  * Supervisor clones employee's FY19 plan to create a template for the FY20 plan
    * ***NOTE: FY19 Supervisors should clone all of their direct reports' performance plans to create, sign, and submit the FY20 plan even if an empoloyee will not be reporting into them in FY20 (i.e. post TTS reorg). If updates need to be made to the FY20 performance plan, the FY20 Supervisor will need to [re-open the FY20 performance plan in HR Links]({{site.baseurl}}/performance-management/#re-opening-a-performance-plan) (Supervisors will be notified via email when an employee has been reassigned to them). The FY20 supervisor should connect with new direct report(s) to discuss any potential changes to their FY20 performance plan.***
  * Employee discusses FY20 performance plan updates with their supervisor
  * Employee works with their Supervisor to make updates to the FY20 performance plan in HR Links
  * Supervisor ["signs and submits"]({{site.baseurl}}/performance-management/#submitting-a-performance-plan-for-employee-approval) the FY20 performance plan in HR Links
* Employee should [“acknowledge”]({{site.baseurl}}/performance-management/#acknowledging-a-performance-plan) their FY20 performance plan by November 14

*Note: FY20 performance plans may be further modified in the first few months of the new fiscal year to account for any updates to TTS and/or Business Unit level specific measure that leadership determines necessary. If this takes place, performance plans will need to be updated and re-established so that employees can be rated against those updated performance plans.*

### Confirming that performance plans have been established

It is critical that all FY19 performance plan evaluations are acknowledged by employees before November 14 and all FY20 performance plans are acknowledged by employees before November 29. The status of employee performance management can be checked in the *Team Performance Supervisor dashboard*:

#### Gather supporting documentation

Supporting documentation that aligns with your Performance Management Plan is ***optional*** for the performance review process. Examples of supporting documentation include emails, written performance counseling, customer feedback, survey results, supervisory notes, database/spreadsheets, and/or work samples within the current rating cycle.

This information can be shared with your Supervisor during your 1:1 performance review conversation that will take place October 21 - November 7.

#### TTS performance rating tool
Use of this tool is optional but can be helpful in determining what your end-of-year rating may be once the performance review is complete. This tool can be used as a reference during your 1:1 performance review session with your supervisor. Note that your supervisor will make final rating determinations on all specific measures associated with your performance plan.

* [Performance rating tool](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ayWnEowb8b9KT6rlQC9BwLLeV4ZkVVLRk4BBaY0LvGA)
  1. Make a copy of the tool 
  1. Personalize the template corresponding to your performance plan structure and weight distribution
  1. Assign a performance rating to your specific measures within each of the five critical elements
    * The tool will calculate your overall rating for each critical element and automatically populate the summary tab to produce an overall performance rating.

#### Discussing performance expectations with a new direct report

When an employee joins TTS or changes supervisors within TTS, it is important that the supervisor establish new performance expectations with the employee through dialogue and ultimately in the official [performance plan]({{site.baseurl}}/performance-management/#creating-a-new-performance-plan). Performance expectations must be developed to describe the expected level of performance at a Level 3 rating; supervisors are encouraged to establish performance expectations for other levels if deemed appropriate. 

* Suggestions of performance expectations that you can discuss and set with your direct report:
  * improvements in effectiveness, productivity, and performance quality
  * cost efficiency
  * timeliness of performance
  * customer service

* Performance expectations should:
  * align with GSA, business, office, work unit, team goals and objectives
  * be attainable, but challenging
  * be clearly worded and measurable

* [InSite Performance Management Guide](https://insite.gsa.gov/topics/hr-pay-and-leave/performance-management/planning-performance)
  * Page 19 - Managers Guide End of Year Review & Establishing Expectations
    
#### Performance improvement plans

Employees who will be rated at Level 1 or 2 in any category on their FY19 Performance Plan must be issued a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP)[Level 1 rating] or Performance Action Plan (PAP)[Level 2 rating].  To initiate this process, reach out to [Lakita Rivero](mailto:lakita.rivero@gsa.gov), TTS’s Employee & Labor Relations Specialist.  Lakita will work directly with you to create the PIP/PAP for your team member; supporting [documentation](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1A0V_EX5dFwtmMVrfGKJ9DxPM9_3vF49MRD5LKImIkb8) will need to be submitted to Lakita for review when creating the PIP/PAP.

The fully vetted PIP/PAP must be issued to the employee **by the last working day of the FY19 performance cycle, September 30, 2019**.  Please note that PIP/PAPs must be reviewed by Legal, which takes a few days, before those plans can be presented to the employee.

#### Verifying your direct reports

**FY19 Audit:** In preparation for the FY19 End-of-Year Employee Performance Review Cycle, please conduct an audit of your Direct Reports in HR Links by following the instructions in the [FY19 Direct Report Audit Survey](https://forms.gle/oLJJcZ4Cf3DdUGHy8).

All supervisors should complete the FY19 audit by **COB September 24th**, so please fill out the above survey if you have not yet.

**FY20 Audit:** Once the TTS reorg has been completed, the Performance Management team will communicate to Supervisors to do a new audit of their Direct Reports in HR Links by following the instructions in the [FY20 Direct Report Audit Survey](https://forms.gle/oLtit3o2MLsSUonx5).

#### 1 on 1 performance discussion

This meeting is an opportunity to rate, recognize and give your direct report constructive feedback (formal or informal) regarding the results of their work within the established expectations, goals, and objectives outlined in the performance plan.  If your direct report has filled out a [performance rating tool](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ayWnEowb8b9KT6rlQC9BwLLeV4ZkVVLRk4BBaY0LvGA), this meeting would be a good time to review it with them.

See below for how to prepare for this meeting.

#### Preparing for 1 on 1 performance discussion 

Gather emails, written performance counseling, customer feedback, survey results, supervisory notes, database/spreadsheets, and/or work samples about the employee’s performance that you observed within the current rating cycle. Prepare feedback for your direct reports that's backed with specific data points and examples, regardless of whether it will be constructive criticism or praise. When providing constructive criticism, it is recommended that you have clear examples of the desired behavior. 

Here’s a pre-feedback checklist you may want to consider:

* Have you prepared a balanced list of key strengths and development areas to discuss?
* Were any of the current developmental areas discussed previously? If so, how are you incorporating that into the upcoming feedback session?
* Is your feedback fair, accurate, and directly applicable to the employee’s performance requirements?
* Do your comments focus on single behaviors that direct the employee’s attention to specific and important improvements?
* Are you prepared to share specific examples of each strength and/or development area?
* Can you describe actions or behaviors the individual can change?
* Are your comments straightforward without adding caveats?
* Do you have a plan for regular check-ins to ensure consistent and ongoing development and improvement?

#### Submitting an evaluation for a direct report who isn't assigned to their supervisor in HR Links

For instances when a direct report is not assigned to their first line supervisor in HR Links or their supervisor doesn't have HR Links manager access, there are two primary options for the first line supervisor to be able to contribute to the evaluation:

1. The first line supervisor should have a 1:1 performance discussion with their direct report and then email their evaluation to the second line supervisor who will [submit the evaluation]({{site.baseurl}}/performance-management/#submitting-an-evaluation) in HR Links on the first line supervisor's behalf.
  * ***NOTE: If the employee has submitted a self-assessment in HR Links, the second line supervisor should email or print a copy for the first line supervisor to review prior to the 1:1 meeting.***

1. The second line supervisor can [nominate the first line supervisor as a participant reviewer]({{site.baseurl}}/performance-management/#nominating-participant-reviewers) so that the first line supervisor can submit an evaluation for their direct report in HR Links after the 1:1 discussion.
  * ***NOTE: The nominated supervisor's feedback is not automatically included as a comment in the employees performance review. HR Links creates a separate document, so it is recommended that the second line supervisor cuts and paste the feedback into the summary comments.***  
  
#### Approving/Denying a level 1 or level 5 summary performance rating

If an employee has received a Summary Rating of Level 1 or 5, the evaluation will automatically be routed to the employee’s 2nd level supervisor (the supervisor of the employee’s supervisor) for approval. To approve or deny a Summary Rating of Level 1 or 5, the employee’s 2nd Level Supervisor must follow the instructions below:

* HR Links in-depth guide (with screenshots):
  * [Supervisor (Section 4, Topic 4.1)](https://drive.google.com/open?id=15Xm9NF_KfcWN-ZxPomooowEAq51073Xi)

#### Cancelling an HR Links evaluation

The only time a supervisor may want to cancel an evaluation is when an employee separates and evaluation cannot be completed or it’s not necessary.  Only and HR Admin can cancel “submitted” evaluations.  Please reach out to [Lakita Rivero](mailto:lakita.rivero@gsa.gov) to initiate this process.

#### Overriding an HR Links employee acknowledgement 

A supervisor may need to approve an employee performance plan or employee evaluation on behalf of their employee if the employee is unable to (i.e. on vacation) or refuses to do so (i.e. does not agree with the evaluation).

#### Leveraging diversity performance measure

All FY20 **supervisory performance plans** must include a new “Leveraging Diversity” measure. For guidance on adding this to supervisory plans [click here](https://meet.google.com/linkredirect?authuser=0&dest=http%3A%2F%2Fcorporateapps.gsa.gov%2Fwordpress%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2019%2F09%2FMandatoryLeadingPeopleCriticalElement_Supervisors.pdf) and/or attend a Supervisor's Lounge session (see below). 

### Additional training

#### Supervisors’ Lounge Question and Answer Sessions

These sessions will feature a demo showing how to incorporate organizational measures into the performance plan. Both sessions will go over the same content, so Supervisors can attend either one.  The links below lead to OLU where you can sign up for a session:
