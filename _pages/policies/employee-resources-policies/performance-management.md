### Performance improvement plans

To initiate this process, reach out to [Lakita Rivero](mailto:lakita.rivero@gsa.gov), TTS’s Employee & Labor Relations Specialist.  Lakita will work directly with you to create the PIP/PAP for your team member; supporting [documentation](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1A0V_EX5dFwtmMVrfGKJ9DxPM9_3vF49MRD5LKImIkb8) will need to be submitted to Lakita for review when creating the PIP/PAP.

The fully vetted PIP/PAP must be issued to the employee **by the last working day of the FY19 performance cycle, September 30, 2019**.  Please note that PIP/PAPs must be reviewed by Legal, which takes a few days, before those plans can be presented to the employee.
