title: Employee Assistance Program (EAP)
---

EAPs offer free, **confidential** counseling and emergency backup care for children and elders.

## Counseling

Like most agencies, our EAP offers assistance for a variety of situations, including depression, anxiety, relationship issues, alcohol or drug abuse, finances, and general health. The EAP helps employees – and where feasible their families – with problems that may affect their well-being and their ability to do their jobs.
