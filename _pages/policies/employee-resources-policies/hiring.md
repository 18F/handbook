## Types of Hiring Actions at TTS

### Competitive (Career) and Excepted Service Hiring Actions via the Merit Promotion Process

For more information on hiring via the Competitive Service (Career) Merit Promotion Process or the Excepted Service version of the Merit Promotion Process, please visit the [Promotions](https://handbook.18f.gov/promotions/) page of the handbook.

### TTS Internal Competitions & Developmental Opportunities

The following explains the process for initiating TTS internal competitions (e.g. directors, supervisors) and developmental opportunities (e.g. details, leads).

For detailed information specific to initiating an internal or external detail, please review the [details page]({{site.baseurl}}/assignee-detail) of the handbook.<br>

Please note the following:

- There must be a vacant Position Number available for your team (or PN that will soon become vacant - if this is replacing a current employee in the position being advertised)
  - If you do not know how many vacancies your team has, please reach out to the Finance team
- It must be prioritized by the Director of your office

Talent will assist with the following:
- Reviewing the job announcement
- Posting the announcement 
- Submitting the PAR action to HR 

The hiring action owner is responsible for developing job materials and interacting with applicants (employees). 

#### Job Prep

- Once the prioritized role is ready to be worked on, please use the following templates (make sure to make a copy of each template)

  - [TTSJobs Announcement Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YIliZcF8dhqs4GzBAKYj5niqdgcN4tggTTDl3zeIOO8/edit?usp=sharing) 
  - [TTSJobs Application Form Template](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1fXSPemwm_U-uhBTT92FnAZAlBubF1-Eg8c3y5TnReEg/edit)
    - Please follow the instructions [here] when creating this form

- In addition to the information within the templates, the hiring manager will need to manage the following: 
  - Developing the interview process
  - Scheduling the interviews
  - Making the selection
  - Letting the Talent Team know who was selected for the position

Once the TTSJobs Announcement is complete, Talent will:

- Add it to [#ttsjobs](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/messages/ttsjobs/) on Slack informing everyone of the new opportunity
- Add it to [TTSJobs Listings]({{site.baseurl}}/ttsjobs/#announcements)


#### Qualification

The hiring team is responsible for confirming the applicants meet the qualifications outlined in the posting  (i.e. GS level, required experience).

For HR to move forward with a selection, the applicant must meet the following qualifications:

- been on their current PD for at least 90 days
- must hold the same grade level as the PD or have at least one year of specialized experience at the next grade below
  - if applicant is at the grade below, they will need to provide an updated resume and HR will need to qualify them. **This means Supervisors should NOT announce who they have selected until HR approves the selection**
- If the role being advertised is a detail and does not have a PD associated with it, then any GS level can apply, unless the HM specifies which GS levels they are accepting.


#### Selection

When the team has determined who they would like to place in the role, they must:

- First confirm with the employee’s supervisor that they are OK with this employee moving to their team
- Forward the supervisor's approval to Talent. Talent will need to submit a Reassignment PAR to HR.

It is the responsibility of the HM provide applications with the applicable feedback, whether that is letting the applicant know they are moving forward in the process, that they have been selected or that they have been rejected (including providing feedback why if applicable). Talent will not notify nor offer feedback to applicants.

**If you are advertising a detail:** the action can only be submitted for a time period of no more than 120 days. The detail can then be extended for another 120 days If the HM and the employee’s supervisor agree to extend.

### Excepted Service or Competitive Service Hiring Actions filled via open and public competition

These actions are the most common type of actions across TTS. Information about the process related to these actions can be found in the [guide to the Talent Acquisition Work System](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LBEpOnJWiSk-4bQ23lGkPPGzAMPWko8Zr2PtFJ9t29w/edit?usp=sharing)
