This section provides a brief overview of the types of hiring actions along with any related process information.

If you'd like to see a list of all the open hiring actions across TTS, please visit [the TTSJobs handbook page]({{site.baseurl}}/ttsjobs)

## Types of Hiring Actions at TTS

### Competitive (Career) and Excepted Service Hiring Actions via the Merit Promotion Process

For more information on hiring via the Competitive Service (Career) Merit Promotion Process or the Excepted Service version of the Merit Promotion Process, please visit the [Promotions](https://handbook.18f.gov/promotions/) page of the handbook.

### TTS Internal Competitions & Developmental Opportunities

The following explains the process for initiating TTS internal competitions (e.g. directors, supervisors) and developmental opportunities (e.g. details, leads).

For detailed information specific to initiating an internal or external detail, please review the [details page]({{site.baseurl}}/assignee-detail) of the handbook.<br>

Please note the following:

- There must be a vacant Position Number available for your team (or PN that will soon become vacant - if this is replacing a current employee in the position being advertised)
  - If you do not know how many vacancies your team has, please reach out to the Finance team
- It must be prioritized by the Director of your office

Talent will assist with the following:
- Reviewing the job announcement
- Posting the announcement 
- Submitting the PAR action to HR 

The hiring action owner is responsible for developing job materials and interacting with applicants (employees). 

#### Job Prep

- Once the prioritized role is ready to be worked on, please use the following templates (make sure to make a copy of each template)

  - [TTSJobs Announcement Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YIliZcF8dhqs4GzBAKYj5niqdgcN4tggTTDl3zeIOO8/edit?usp=sharing) 
  - [TTSJobs Application Form Template](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1fXSPemwm_U-uhBTT92FnAZAlBubF1-Eg8c3y5TnReEg/edit)


- In addition to the information within the templates, the hiring manager will need to manage the following: 
  - Developing the interview process
  - Scheduling the interviews
  - Making the selection
  - Letting the Talent Team know who was selected for the position

Once the TTSJobs Announcement is complete, Talent will:

- Add it to [#ttsjobs](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/messages/ttsjobs/) on Slack informing everyone of the new opportunity
- Add it to [TTSJobs Listings]({{site.baseurl}}/ttsjobs/#announcements)


#### Qualification

The hiring team is responsible for confirming the applicants meet the qualifications outlined in the posting  (i.e. GS level, required experience).

For HR to move forward with a selection, the applicant must meet the following qualifications:

- been on their current PD for at least 90 days
- must hold the same grade level as the PD or have at least one year of specialized experience at the next grade below
  - if applicant is at the grade below, they will need to provide an updated resume and HR will need to qualify them. **This means Supervisors should NOT announce who they have selected until HR approves the selection**
- If the role being advertised is a detail and does not have a PD associated with it, then any GS level can apply, unless the HM specifies which GS levels they are accepting.


#### Selection

When the team has determined who they would like to place in the role, they must:

- First confirm with the employee’s supervisor that they are OK with this employee moving to their team
- Forward the supervisor's approval to Talent. Talent will need to submit a Reassignment PAR to HR.

It is the responsibility of the HM provide applications with the applicable feedback, whether that is letting the applicant know they are moving forward in the process, that they have been selected or that they have been rejected (including providing feedback why if applicable). Talent will not notify nor offer feedback to applicants.

**If you are advertising a detail:** the action can only be submitted for a time period of no more than 120 days. The detail can then be extended for another 120 days If the HM and the employee’s supervisor agree to extend.

### Excepted Service or Competitive Service Hiring Actions filled via open and public competition

These actions are the most common type of actions across TTS. Information about the process related to these actions can be found in the [guide to the Talent Acquisition Work System](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LBEpOnJWiSk-4bQ23lGkPPGzAMPWko8Zr2PtFJ9t29w/edit?usp=sharing)

## How to write a Federal resume

*Written by [Amanda Costello](https://github.com/amandacostello), 18F content designer and gummi bear enthusiast, July 10, 2019.*

**Writing a US federal resume is hard.** When I started writing mine, all I wanted was a solid example. What needs to be there, in what order, and what would it look like with real information. This is that example. (***Law and Order chimes***)

Below are excerpts from my federal resume, along with details and notes about how it’s written and formatted. I want more awesome folks from all backgrounds and experiences as colleagues. I don’t want the resume formatting or particulars to be a mystery; it’s already a very challenging piece of writing.

### General things to keep in mind:

1. This resume’s job is to connect the requirements of the job posting to your experience using the **straightest possible line**. I printed out the job posting and highlighted every key phrase of the requirements, qualifications, and what kind of work this job would do. I then made that into a checklist to make sure each one of those things could clearly be mapped to my resume. 
2. **Throw out your formatting.** I used CAPS for headers, italics for mission statements, and bullet points. Expect that the bulk of your formatting will be stripped out. No columns, no fanciness. Just write. Hard. 
3. **Speaking of writing: get your words going, and then get more words.** I had to submit two writing samples, and that was where I could show off my content strategy particulars. Remember the job of the resume content: clear, straight lines between the requirements and your experience.

> Explicit disclaimer: This resume format is what I chose to use in applying to 18F in the US Federal Government’s General Services Administration. It is not the only acceptable format, but is what worked well for me. I currently work as a content designer at 18F, but put this together on my own time, using no government resources to do so. Using this formatting is not a guarantee of consideration. You still gotta do the work. 

Want to chat more about this? I’m on Twitter: [@amandaesque](https://www.twitter.com/amandaesque)

My comments below will all be in `code demo backticks`.

### And now, the resume!

`Everything about this top material is standardized formatting. Go ahead and put your own info in just like this. `

AMANDA COSTELLO  
123 Lutefisk Street  
You Betcha, MN 55555  
Mobile: 555-555-5555  

Email:   
Availability: April 1, 2020   
Job Type: Permanent, Telework
Work Schedule: Full-Time

Desired locations:  
United States - MN  

#### WORK EXPERIENCE
`Below is an example of one job, and how I talked about it. I recommend listing as complete of a job history as you can for at least the last 7 years, more ideally the last 10 years. Here's a formatting example!`

Workplace name, Unit name if relevant - City, State, Country  
Your job title - MM/YYYY to MM/YYYY - Hours per week: xx  

_Mission statement(s) of the workplace, or summary of the company’s work on a larger scale._

DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES
A paragraph-long description of what the work was overall. Describe your work using a wide scope, leaving the specific details for later. 

SPECIFIC TOPIC (e.g. CONTENT STRATEGY)
 
* Examples are in a bulleted list, each point describing a project or part of a project, or a piece of work that fits the heading, plus matches up with the qualifications/reqs. 
* I chose to start each bullet with a past tense verb (Collaborated, Wrote, Managed, Edited), because that’s how I usually write resumes. 
* Some of these bullets reference specific things I wrote, and those were included as writing samples with my application. 

TECHNICAL SKILLS: 

Software you know, tools you use, best practices and methods. This can’t just be a list, but has to have context in your work overview of how and why they were used. Also, please throw Microsoft Word on there because I was once rejected from a job in 2007 because I put “Microsoft Office” and the listing said “Microsoft Word.” Word matching! Seriously!

SELECTED WORK:

* Another bulleted list, this time of URLs related to work I did.
* They had quick little blurbs underneath about what they were, and what I did. 
* Photos won’t come through on this resume, so no screenshots or anything.

`End of formatting example!`


University of Minnesota, College of Education and Human Development - Minneapolis, MN  
Lead Content Strategist - 07/2012 to Present - Hours per week: 40  

_The mission of the College of Education and Human Development is to contribute to a just and sustainable future through engagement with the local and global communities to enhance human learning and development at all stages of the life span. The college is part of the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities, a land-grant high-level research institution, dedicated to generating and preserving knowledge through research, sharing that knowledge through teaching and learning, and apply that knowledge through outreach and public service._

DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES
Developed and led college-wide content strategy combining current and prospective student needs with college goals for recruitment and retention. Worked as a member of a cross-functional team including designers, developers, business analysts, marketers, and well as content strategists across 7 academic departments to promote and deliver effective processes and consistent content strategy.

CONTENT STRATEGY:

* Collaborated with college academic departments, research centers, student support offices, and senior leadership to develop a “bottom up” content strategy, prioritizing student needs based on their relationships with academic programs. Assessed content through the lens of recruitment and retention.
* Wrote “Stakeholder’s Guide To Launch,” a two-page reference for the launch of a new college website. By anticipating the top questions stakeholders might field, this guide gave talking points surrounding new features, along with contacts for further questions. 
* Served as strategist, editor, and project manager for regular essay series on college diversity and inclusion work, written by academic leadership. This generated authentic, meaningful content and helped stakeholders better understand the time commitment involved in content production. 
* Established user-centered college voice and tone guidelines, using “A, but not B” format. This was informed by close work with students in formal and informal usability testing, and brand sort activities with college leadership and key stakeholders.

USER EXPERIENCE (UX) WRITING:

* Combined findings from user research, new graduate student interviews, faculty and researcher focus groups, higher ed industry trends, and analytics to consolidate more than 600 areas of academic research expertise into 111 categories. Categories were deployed across the college for consistent organization and increased findability of research work. 
* Developed strategy and standards to categorize and sort 127 academic programs and 111 areas of research expertise. This was incorporated into two web-based tools developed in-house and allowed students to explore college offerings and expertise independent of department. Wrote and edited descriptions for each area, capped at 25 words to promote ease of reading and top-level understanding.
* Planned, edited, and delivered a “Web Writing Best Practices” guide for college content strategists. Formatted as a “one-pager” for printing and pinning up as a reference, this collected links to and recommendations from external tools and guides (Hemingway, 18F, King County Editorial Guide), internal editorial recommendations from the university and college, and voice and tone particulars. Strategists often felt intimidated and overwhelmed by the sheer amount of recommendations connected to good web content; this guide promoted four starting points to improve content: addressing the user (you/your/yours and we/our/ours), employing structured content, concise writing, and using plain language.

USABILITY TESTING AND USER RESEARCH:

* Led and managed annual process of web usability testing, including project kick-offs, stakeholder workshops, scenario development, task analysis, lab and field-based testing, issues analysis, research and recommendation presentations to project team members, key stakeholders and college senior leadership. 
* Helped subject-matter expert teams and stakeholders understand their users through research and usability testing methods, defining problems and crafting effective solutions based on both quantitative and qualitative data. 

COLLABORATION ON CROSS-FUNCTIONAL TEAMS:

* Contributed to responsive redesign of college website by conducting a content audit, editing student-facing content for an overall 75% file reduction, and migrating updated content to custom-built CMS. Collaborated with design and development teams to create comprehensive style guides, pattern library interface copy.
* Convened monthly “coworking days” among all college web professionals, bringing us together as a team of peers for a day of training, collaborative problem solving, idea sharing, and camaraderie. Set programming, mentored colleagues on presentations, and collected feedback to regularly adjust how our central content strategy was best supporting the specific work of the departments. 

ADVOCACY AND OUTREACH:

* Advocated for content strategy best practices to over 30 University departments by regularly meeting with peers and presenting to leadership stakeholder groups. Promoted clear, consistent, user-centered writing from all contributors, even those who don’t identify as “web people,” and facilitated collaboration across organizational silos to increase efficiency and support. 
* Consulted with faculty and staff in academic departments outside the college that frequently contributed to content strategy. Regular guest lecturer and student mentor in the Writing Studies program.
* Contributed as one of four subject matter experts to the University of Minnesota’s Content Strategy Self-Help Guide, recommending resources and structuring process for the centrally-maintained system to help contributors at all levels improve content writing and strategic thinking for the web.
* Frequently presented at local Twin Cities-based tech meetups, translating content strategy best practices to adjacent fields such as front- and back-end development, UX research, accessibility, interactive design, and marketing.

TECHNICAL SKILLS: 

Provided strategic content design with skills in copywriting, style guides, plain language, comprehension/reading levels. Conducted usability evaluations using card sorting (OptimumSort), tree testing (Treejack), direct observation user research methods. Worked on a cross-functional team that used Asana, Trello, Slack, Hemingway, pattern libraries, Google Drive, MS Office Suite (Word, Excel, Power Point), and semantic HTML. 

SELECTED WORK:

* CEHD Academic Programs, www.cehd.umn.edu/programs  
  Developed content and structure for directory/sorting tool  
* CEHD Research & Expertise, www.cehd.umn.edu/topics/  
  Created new content structure around college research, including categories and descriptions

  Subject matter expert for update to university-wide guide
