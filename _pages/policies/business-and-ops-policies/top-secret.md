title: Top Secret / Sensitive Compartmented Information (TS/SCI) Clearance
---

For certain projects, clients need employees to have this type of clearance so that they are able to view certain documents.  This is the process for TTS employees to request this clearance.

## Request process

1. Work with your supervisor to complete the following documents:
  * [GSA Position Risk Determination Survey](https://goo.gl/nC9D5S)
    * For Question #7 refer to pages A108-112 of the Cybersecurity Guide and choose only one code

  * Supervisor must write up a Justification explaining why this clearance is necessary
    * [Sample Justification](https://goo.gl/1baZSd)
    * Update your government style resume

  * If you have been employed at GSA for over one year complete the following documents:
    * [GSA Credit Report](https://goo.gl/GiFhBy)
    * [Declaration of Federal Employment](https://goo.gl/uzKcVn)

2. Email items a,b,c, & d to the [Talent Team](mailto:TTS-Talent-team@gsa.gov).  They will contact HR to take one of the following steps:
  * If you are on an individual PD (i.e. supervisory innovation specialist):
    * HR will only need to update that PD
  * If you are on one of our standard PDs (i.e. innovation specialist), HR will need to create a new PD.
    * HR will send Talent, Form OF-8 that your supervisor will need to sign
    * Once PD approved and OF-8 submitted, Talent will create an RPA, which moves you to the new PD

3. HR will review all items and submit to Security

4. You will receive an email asking you to update your eQIP.  You’ll have 7 days to complete.

5. Once the eQIP is complete, security will review and send to OPM.  Security will complete this within 1-3 days
  * It will take approximately 8-15 months to complete the TS portion. This delay is due to the backlogs at OPM. The SCI portion is controlled by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and can only be requested after the TS is complete.  You should plan an additional 4-6 weeks for that process.
