Most TTS employees have a Public Trust (Moderate Risk - Level 5) clearance. However, for certain projects, clients need TTS employees to have a higher type of clearance so that they are able to view certain documents.  This is the process for TTS employees to request this clearance.

[See Wikipedia for a list of different types of security clearances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._security_clearance_terms).

## Check your security clearance status

1. Log into [HRLinks]({{site.baseurl}}/leave/#logging-into-hr-links)
2. Click on the **Navigator** icon in the top right hand corner
3. Click on "Self Service"
4. Click on "Personal Information"
5. Click on "Employee Self Service"
6. Click on "Employee Security Clearance"

*Note: If you do not have access to HRLinks, you can email [gsa.securityoffice@gsa.gov](mailto:gsa.securityoffice@gsa.gov) to check you security clearance information.*

## Request process

### 1. Work with your supervisor to complete the following documents:
* [GSA Position Risk Determination Survey](https://goo.gl/nC9D5S)
   * For Question #7 refer to pages 4-10 of the [Federal Cybersecurity Coding Structure](https://goo.gl/633NXj)  
     * Choose up to 3 codes which describe the type of cybersecurity work assigned to the position, and list them in descending order by majority of work time.

* Supervisor must write up a Justification explaining why this clearance is necessary
   * [Sample Justification](https://goo.gl/FVRmeZ)

* Update your government style resume

* If you have been employed at GSA for over one year complete the following documents:
   * [GSA Credit Report](https://goo.gl/GiFhBy)
   * [Declaration of Federal Employment (OF 306)](https://goo.gl/QDkDZC)

### 2. Email items from Step 1 (updated resume, supervisor justification, GSA PRDS, credit report and Declaration of Federal Employment) to the [People Ops Team](mailto:TTS-PeopleOps@gsa.gov).  They will contact GSA HR to take one of the following steps:
* If you are on an **individual PD** (i.e. supervisory innovation specialist):
   * HR will only need to update that PD
* If you are on a **standard PD** (i.e. innovation specialist):
   * HR will need to create a new PD
   * HR will send People Ops Form OF-8 that your supervisor will need to sign
   * Once new PD is approved and OF-8 is submitted, TTS Talent will create an RPA, which moves you to the new PD
      * Please note that you can not be placed on this new PD until your security clearance is processed by OPM. You may request a waiver justification to be placed on this PD before the clearance goes through ONLY if your PD is classified as critical sensitive (versus special sensitive)
      * Waiver justifications must be written by the supervisor and approved by the FAS Commissioner (Alan Thomas)

### 3. HR will review all items and submit to Security

### 4. You will receive an email asking you to update your eQIP  
* Youâ€™ll have 7 days to complete.

### 5. Once the eQIP is complete, security will review and send to OPM 
* Security will complete this within 1-3 days
* It will take approximately 8-15 months to complete the top secret (TS) portion 
  * This delay is due to the backlogs at OPM. The SCI portion is controlled by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and can only be requested after the TS is complete.  You should plan an additional 4-6 weeks for that process.
  
### 6. When a clearance has been approved, the Security Office informs the employee directly and provides further instructions.
