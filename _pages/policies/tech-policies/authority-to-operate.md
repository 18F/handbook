_This page outlines how we authorize systems to go live in production._

## Overview
GSA Order CIO 2100.1J CHGE 1 April 28, 2016, [GSA Information Technology (IT) Security Policy](https://gsa.gov/portal/getMediaData?mediaId=129634),  provides information on Authorized processing.

The Authorizing Official (AO) must authorize, in writing, all information systems before they go into operation. All GSA information systems must be assessed and authorized at least every three (3) years or whenever there is a significant change to the system’s security posture IAW [NIST SP 800-37](http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-37r1.pdf), Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal Information Systems: A Security Life Cycle Approach, and IT Security Procedural Guide: Managing Enterprise Risk, [OCIO-IT Security-06-30](https://insite.gsa.gov/portal/getMediaData?mediaId=672866).

As part of the assessment and authorization process, all systems must be categorized in accordance with FIPS PUB 199, and NIST SP 800-60. Risk Assessments must be performed IAW NIST SP 800-30. E-authentication risk assessments must be performed IAW OMB M-04-04. All controls must be implemented IAW FIPS PUB 200 and the current version of NIST SP 800-53. All controls must be documented in the system’s security plan IAW NIST SP 800-18, Guide for Developing Security Plans for Information Technology Systems. All controls must be documented and tested IAW NIST SP 800-53A, Assessing Security and Privacy Controls in Federal Information Systems and Organizations: Building Effective Assessment Plans and any other supplemental GSA guidance. In addition, contingency plans must be developed IAW NIST SP 800-34 and have been tested IAW GSA-CIO-IT Security 06-29 within the past year in order for the Authorizing Official to authorize the system to operate (i.e. accredit).

A [Lightweight ATO](https://insite.gsa.gov/portal/getMediaData?mediaId=659610) (aka Limited ATO) can be issued to a Low or Moderate impact system for an initial ninety (90) day period based on the results of a Pen Test. This can be extended up to a year for Moderate or a full three year ATO for low impact systems in the GSAIT organization, pursuing an agile development methodology AND residing on infrastructures that have a GSA ATO concurred by the GSA CISO or a FedRAMP ATO.

Information systems with expiring ATO may request a one-time extension of the current authorization for a period not to exceed one year from the date of ATO expiration if during this time the system will be decommissioned or to allow development of near real-time continuous monitoring capabilities to support ongoing authorization. ATO extensions must be supported by current vulnerability assessment results (operating system, database, and web (as applicable)) and POA&M identifying weaknesses from all sources. AOs must obtain approval from the CISO for the continuous monitoring plans of systems authorizations that have been extended. Plans must be approved within 6 months of the extension. New systems and systems that have undergone or are undergoing a significant change must adhere to the current GSA Risk Management Framework processes as documented in GSA CIO-IT Security-06-30.

AOs must ensure risk assessments are performed and documented as part of assessment and authorization activities before a system is placed into production, when significant changes are made to the system and at least every three (3) years or via continuous monitoring based on [GSA CIO IT Security 12-66](https://insite.staging.gsa.gov/portal/getMediaData?mediaId=649274): Continuous Monitoring Program that is reviewed and accepted by the GSA CISO.

The Technology Transformation Service is led by a Commissioner, who directly reports to the Administrator of General Services. In order to support the work done by TTS, the Administrator has delegated all risk acceptance authority to the TTS Commissioner for all systems built or purchased by TTS wherein:

* information is collected or maintained by or on behalf of the agency

* information systems used or operated by GSA or by a contractor of GSA or other organization on behalf of GSA

This scope is defined by the [Federal Information Security Management Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/senate-bill/2521/text?overview=closed). Systems that fall into either of these categories are herein referred to as "TTS systems". In order to ensure that risk for TTS systems is properly assessed and cost-effectively reduced to an appropriate level by senior TTS officials and system owners, the TTS Commissioner can both delegate to TTS Authorizing Officials and designate their representatives to carry out this work.

## Background

Previously, all information systems built, operated, maintained, and owned by OCSIT/18F were authorized by the Deputy Associate Administrator for 18F or other properly delegated OCSIT Authorizing Officials, in keeping with the standard set in NIST FIPS 200 Minimum Security Requirements for Federal Information and Information Systems and elaborated in [NIST SP 800-37 Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal Information Systems](http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-37-rev1/sp800-37-rev1-final.pdf):

> "Accordingly, authorizing officials are in management positions with a level of authority commensurate with understanding and accepting such information system-related security risks." (Page D-4)

In November 2015, delegations of Authorizing Official responsibility were made to deal with the continued growth of OCSIT/18F.

With the restructuring of OCSIT/18F into the TTS, in order to ensure the timeliness, accountability, and quality of forthcoming authorizations, and to ensure that Authorizing Officials have both authority and context sufficient to make risk based decisions, further changes are required.

## Changes in authority

The following delegations and designations are made in the TTS:


* All subsequent delegations or designations are valid for the duration of the employment of the individuals who digitally co-sign this policy and commit said signature into the Handbook.

* Delegations and designations may be revoked by either the TTS Commissioner or the Administrator of the General Services via digital signature.

* All Authorizing Officials formally accept the security responsibility for the operation of a system and their authorizations must declare that their systems are adequately protected.

* The TTS Commissioner hereby delegates the 18F Infrastructure Director, in their role as **Acting TTS Infrastructure Director, as the Authorizing Official responsible for authorizing via digital signature any and all systems**, except for systems categorized at the FIPS High impact level, for either confidentiality, integrity, or availability.

* The Acting TTS Infrastructure Director hereby designates the Infrastructure Leads of the TTS Business Units as **Authorizing Official Designated Representatives** for all systems, and therefore the responsibility for all security planning and "approving the security plan, plans of actions and milestones, the security assessment, and the determination of risk". The Infrastructure Leads must **prepare and approve** via digital signature the final authorization package in a structure data format determined by the Acting TTS Infrastructure Director.

* Any authorization or risk acceptance by the Acting TTS Infrastructure Director is subject to veto, if digitally signed and given in writing, by the TTS Commissioner or TTS Deputy Commissioner.


* All changes in authority take effect immediately upon signature of the TTS Commissioner and counter-signature of the relevant staff. No change in authority is active if a counter-signature of the staff accepting the delegation or designation is missing.
