_The objective of FITARA policy is to improve the management of IT within an agency._

## What is FITARA
The Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA) was enacted on December 19, 2014, and outlines specific requirements related to:
1. CIO authority enhancements
2. Enhanced transparency and improved risk management in IT   investments
3. Portfolio reviews
4. Expansion of training and use of IT cadres
5. Federal Data Center Consolidation Initiative (FDCCI), more recently known as the Data Center Optimization Initiative (DCOI)
6. Maximizing the benefit of the federal strategic sourcing initiative (SSI)
7. Government-wide software purchasing program
The goal of FITARA is to eliminate duplication and waste in information technology acquisition for the federal government.  The goals of the legislation – reduction of duplicative systems, examine software licensing options, making the business case for acquisition, and the consolidation of data centers.

The objective of FITARA is to improve the management of IT within an agency and hence, improve the ability for that agency to deliver its mission and conduct its business.

RE: TTS Policy and Process for GSA Chief Information Officer FITARA Review

1.0 Purpose
To establish a clear internal TTS policy and process to obtain required GSA Chief Information Officer (CIO) FITARA review of TTS contracts and agreements. Additionally, this policy fulfills the GSA Inspector General’s recommendation that TTS ensure compliance with the Federal Information Technology Reform Act (FITARA) and the terms of the June 2, 2015, Memorandum of Agreement that requires CIO review and approval of all contracts or other agreements entered into by 18F to acquire information technology (IT) or IT services. This policy applies to all internal TTS contracts or agreements, as well as external TTS contracts or agreements that leverage GSA IT’s platforms, security or infrastructure.

2.0 Policy and Process
a. Internal contracts or agreements. TTS will submit for review to the GSA IT Chief of Staff and to the GSA TTS Liaison (currently the GSA Chief Technology Officer) all contracts or agreements entered into by TTS to acquire IT or IT services for internal purposes.  The GSA IT Chief of Staff and GSA TTS Liaison will review the contract or agreement. Upon resolution, TTS will route the document for review and approval by the GSA CIO.  By way of example, this includes all contracts or agreements where TTS is providing IT products or services to TTS or another part of GSA.  

b. External contracts or agreements. When TTS is providing IT products or services to another agency, TTS will submit for review to the GSA IT Chief of Staff and to the GSA TTS Liaison (currently the GSA Chief Technology Officer) all contracts or agreements entered into by TTS to acquire IT or IT services if GSA owns the Authority to Operate (ATO) or a GSA-owned platform /infrastructure is being used. The GSA IT Chief of Staff and GSA TTS Liaison will review the contract or agreement, and provide comments to TTS on whether the proposed solution fits within the GSA IT standards and security model. Upon resolution, TTS will route the document for review and approval by the GSA CIO.

If the external contract or agreement does not involve a GSA-owned platform and/or GSA does not own the ATO, no approval from GSA IT is required.

3.0 Applicability
This policy applies to all TTS Offices unless otherwise amended or revoked.*
