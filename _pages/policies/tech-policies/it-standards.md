As government workers doing government work, the software we use to do that work must conform to certain standards.

GSA uses a process called the [IT Standards Approval Process](https://goo.gl/bn0Yme) to review and approve
the software for standards in legal, 508 compliance, security and Enterprise Architecture Committee (EARC).

You can [check if the software](https://goo.gl/rnZjO3) you want to use is already approved.
If it is not, you can request it by [opening a ticket](https://goo.gl/rnZjO3).
