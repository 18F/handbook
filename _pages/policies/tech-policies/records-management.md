This page outlines how to properly treat federal records

## Guidelines

All GSA employees are responsible for records management. The widespread use of electronic mail (gmail) and electronic records through GSAâ€™s online applications has highlighted the need for everyone to understand how to determine which documents are Federal records and how to manage them effectively. Records serve a number of purposes, including:
  
  * planning administrative and program needs
  * documenting GSA activities
  * protecting the agency's legal and financial rights
  * providing for adequate oversight by Congress and other authorized agencies
  * documenting the agency's history
  * providing continuity of operations during an emergency or disaster

Records are critical to an organization to function effectively and efficient. [Visit GSA Insite Records Management Page](https://insite.gsa.gov/topics/directives-forms-and-regulations/records-management) for general procedures on identifying Federal records, determining what documents are needed to document Agency activities, for official files and managing records in accordance with the law.
