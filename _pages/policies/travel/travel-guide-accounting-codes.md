### Multiple Accounting Codes
**MAY NEED UPDATING**
Sometimes, you may have to combine travel that is being billed to a client with travel taken for other 18F business.

For example, you might plan a billable client trip to coincide with the non-billable Offsite All-Hands meeting. Here is how you would go about doing this.

1. Make sure you are on the accounting tab of your authorization.

2. Verify that both your billable and non-billable accounting codes are listed in the favorite accounting codes section. If not, [create some codes](#create-accounting-codes).

3. If all the accounting codes you will need are available in the accounting for the trip, click on the **Allocate** link on any/either of the selected accounting codes.

4. You can either allocate by percentage by selecting the **Document Allocation Level** tab, or by **Expense Level Allocation**. Allocate accordingly and click save.
