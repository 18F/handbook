title: Travel Guide Getting Reimbursed
---

[TOC](/travel-guide-table-of-contents) [Back to Traveling](/travel-guide-4-travel)

So you’ve traveled and want to get reimbursed for all of your expenses! It’s time to return to Concur to create and then submit a voucher.

This guide explains how to do this whether you paid for your expenses on your travel card, personal debit card, or just cold hard cash. Sit back, relax, and just imagine that you are almost done with Concur (which you are at this point)!

Getting reimbursed has 3 sub-steps:

1. [Creating a Voucher](#i-create-a-voucher)

2. [Entering your Expenses](#ii-entering-expenses)

3. [Submitting your Voucher for approval](#iii-submit-voucher-for-approval)

### I. Create A Voucher

1. Log back into [Concur](http://travel.gsa.gov)
2. On the main navigation menu, hover over **Vouchers** and select **New Vouchers**
3. How long was your trip?

    * **Over 12 Hours**: Select the **Voucher from Authorization** option to reimburse a recent trip. **MOST LIKELY OPTION** Continue to the next step

    * **Under 12 Hours**: Select the **Local Voucher** option to reimburse expenses on a trip under 12 hours that does not include per diem. (Instructions Pending)

    * **I actually haven't travelled yet!**: Select the **PreTrip Voucher from Authorization** can be used to reimburse travel expenses in advance (but not typically used).

4. You will then be lead through creating an authorization voucher.

    * Under Document Search, you’ll see a list of your “open” authorizations (i.e. your authorizations that don’t have vouchers yet).

    * Hit the pencil button to select the authorization you’d like to be reimbursed for.

    * **TIP**: If you can't figure out which authorization is your recent trip by name, look at the departure date column.

5. Your **Document Information** will appear and be autopopulated.
    * If the **Trip Name** does not autopopulate, enter it in this format `BILLABLE or NON-BILLABLE: [Exact Name of Tock Project]` that you would bill the trip to. For example, a non-billable trip for ops would be `NON-BILLABLE: Ops/ Acquisitions`. Team Travel will return vouchers that don’t follow this format, so again, please make sure you name your trip using the above convention.

    * **Is your trip both Billable and non-billable?** Enter the trip name as `MIXED: [Your (non-billable) line of business]/[Exact Name of Tock Category]` to invoice billable part of trip to.

    * Click on **Create Document**

6. Now it's time to enter your expenses!

### II. Entering Expenses
Now you need to make sure each of your expenses is accounted for. This step is arguably the most important part of the “vouchering” process.

1. Navigate to the **Expenses & Receipts.** tab of your voucher.
    * **Just finished creating your voucher in the steps listed above?** You'll be coming from the **General** Tab of your voucher

    * **Just logged back in to Concur?** You'll be coming from the **Summary** Tab of your voucher

2. Enter your expenses based on the list below and add receipts as necessary.

    * [Airfare or Amtrak tickets purchased through Concur](#airfare-or-rail)

    * [Meals and Incidental Expenses](#meals-and-incidental-expenses)

    * [Local transportation (Metro, taxis, etc.)](#local-transportation)

    * [Hotels](#hotels)

    * [“Other” expenses: checked baggage, laundry, etc.](#other-common-expenses)

    * [Uncommon Expenses](#uncommon-expenses)

3. [Proceed to submitting your voucher](#iii-submit-voucher-for-approval)


#### Airfare or Rail
* Did you book airfare or rail outside of Concur? [Yes](#air-outside-of-concur)

* Airfare is already on the **Expenses & Receipts** Tab under the **Expense List**
The blue icon under **Source** means that it was paid for via Concur. No further action is needed.

* **For example**: This example trip was taken between 9/16 and 9/18. M&IE is $71 per day in DC in September, and is 75% of $71 ($53.25) on the first and last days of a trip. **We see that the three days of M&IE has been added automatically.** Nothing else to do here.

#### Meals and Incidental Expenses

* **The allowance for Meals and Incidental Expenses (M&IE) is a flat rate given to a traveler regardless of what they actually spent.** No receipts or justification is needed to receive M&IE.

* If you need to cut out meals and incidental expenses for some days (for example, a weekend of personal time spent in DC), the [Airfare and Rail](#airfare-or-rail) section.

#### Local Transportation
This is also a general description of how to add an expense.

1. Click on **Add Expense**
2. Fill out the **Add Expense Details** on the right hand sidebar.

    * For **Expense Date**, enter the date the purchase was made (As it appears on the receipt)

    * Click on **Expense Description** to bring up a drop-down list of possible expense options. For example, if you want to get reimbursed for a $10 metro fare, pick `Public Transportation`.

3. Fill out the two additional fields that pop-up

    * **Cost:** The amount you are looking to get reimbursed.

    * **Payment Method:**

        * **Did you pay on your personal credit/debit card or in cash?** Select **CASH**.

        * **Did you pay it on your travel card?** Select **IBA**. If you don’t see IBA, please go back to Pre-Step C and ensure that you have entered your travel card into Concur.

4. Click on **Show other details** to expand the expense details.

    * Fill out the Comments _section for any local transportation related expense_: public transit, taxi, etc.

    * A description, especially for taxis, should be specific for each instance: i.e. taxi from airport to office.

    * For public transit, a “blanket entry” for all reasonable transportation expenses is OK. For example, an entry for $10 in transit fares, with the above comment describing all travel made would be fine. Just make sure that the amount on the entry matches the amount listed on the receipt.

5. Click **Save** and you will see a warning to add your receipt.

6. At the bottom of the screen, in the receipts menu, click **Attach Receipt Images** to add a new receipt.

7. When the upload menu pops up, click **Choose File**. Upload only one receipt at a time or Concur will get upset.

8. Click **Attach** at the bottom of the pop-up.

9. Click **Done** once the file has uploaded successfully. There is (surprisingly) no need to associate an expense with any given receipt.

10. Repeat the upload process for each individual receipt.

#### Hotels
* Now, we will need to address the question of hotels. Hotels are usually added automatically whether booked in Concur or not. They are usually assumed to be at the government maximum rate unless otherwise specified.

* In your **Expense List**, you will see your reservation, but without tax.

1. Click **Add Expense** to add the _Lodging Tax_.

2. Add the following **Expense Details**:
* **Create Expenses Through:** Enter the last night you were checked into the hotel, and each night’s lodging tax will be copied through.

* **Expense Date:** The night that you checked in.

* **Expense Description:** Lodging Tax

* **Cost:** Tax per night (tax can also be reported as a lump sum, though lodging itself must be broken out per night)

* **Payment Method:**

    * **Did you pay on your personal credit/debit card or in cash?** Select **CASH**.

    * **Did you pay it on your travel card?** Select **IBA**. If you don’t see IBA, please go back to Pre-Step C and ensure that you have entered your travel card into Concur.

3. Click **Save**

4. At the bottom of the screen, in the receipts menu, click **Attach Receipt Images** to add a new receipt.

5. When the upload menu pops up, click **Choose File**. Upload only one receipt at a time or Concur will get upset.

6. Click **Attach** at the bottom of the pop-up.

7. Click **Done** once the file has uploaded successfully. There is (surprisingly) no need to associate an expense with any given receipt.

8. Repeat the upload process for each individual receipt.

#### Other Common Expenses
With all transport and lodging added to this voucher, the only item left to add would be other charges. One of the most common among these would be a charge for checked luggage. This would fall under the **Baggage Fees** category.

Please see the description for [how to add a local transportation expense](#local-transportation).

#### Uncommon Expenses

##### Rental Cars
It's coming!

##### Personal Vehicle Use
It's coming!

##### Parking
It's coming!

#### Air Outside of Concur
It's  coming!

### III. Submit Voucher for Approval
Routing a voucher is now exactly the same as submitting an authorization as seen in when we [submitted our authorization for approval](/travel-guide-3-approval/#iv-submit-authorization-for-approval).

1. Navigate to the **Perform Pre-Audits** Tab for your voucher.

    * You will now see a list of all the items that might cause a fail or hardfail for the voucher to be approved.

    * Any _HARDFAIL_ must be corrected before the submission of the authorization-- i.e. accounting codes must be added. Likely causes for _HARDFAILS_ are the lack of accounting codes. If you are seeing this fail, please go back up to the [Enter Accounting Codes section of this guide](/travel-guide-3-approval/#iii-enter-accounting-codes).

    *  Likely _FAILS_ arise when non-government contract flight was selected in [Choosing a flight 2](/travel-guide-2-choose-your-itinerary/#choose-a-flight) or if your booked a hotel outside of Concur. An authorization with a _FAIL_ may still be submitted, but should be justified in some way. For example, the choice of flight may be justified if there were no government contract flights available or if a non-contract fare was less expensive.

3. Correct or justify failures. To justify a _FAIL_, you may add an explanation after clicking Justify Pre-Audit Results.  If you need further assistance, please drop a message in #travel or reach out to the team via email 18f-travel@gsa.gov.

4. Click **Submit** (in the upper right hand corner of your voucher)

5. Stamping
   * You will be taken to a document history page. If your **“Status to Apply”** is **“Submit to Approver”**, then click **Stamp and Submit Document** at either the top or the bottom of the page and continue. If not, please correct any other failures.

   * The next page will show you your pre-audit results again, in case you missed that step. If nothing is awry, go ahead and click **Continue Stamping the Document.**

   * It doesn’t look like it, but when you see **Close Post Stamping Document Closure Screen**, you are done!

Congrats!!! Your voucher has been submitted. You don’t even have to click the button again (but you can if you want).

## YOU'RE DONE!!!
