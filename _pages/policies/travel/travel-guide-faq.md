###Is it possible to travel before the actual date that I am scheduled to arrive for work at my temporary duty station?  Conversely, may I stay longer than my scheduled days of work?

[Additional Info on this](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1Lxnea7PmBZQeKwe-zkg1XNoIYYhFeglv29ls2NKudLE/edit)

Jaime will be traveling to visit a partner agency in September.  She sees an opportunity to arrive early and visit a few days with family members before beginning her work duties.

This is acceptable.  You will need the authorization of your supervisor.  What you need to know is the following:  You will only be reimbursed for accommodations, local travel costs and per diem during the period for which you are scheduled to work.  Any additional evenings of accommodations (as well as local travel costs and per diem) are on your own dime.  You will have to pay for the nights for which you are staying prior to, or post, your actual scheduled days of work. In addition, your per diem only kicks in during your actual days of scheduled work.

> To: Supervisor

> I would like to arrive early for my meeting with [agency] and spend some time with my family. I plan on traveling Friday, September 25, and would return September 30. I understand that all other travel expenses including lodging and meals before Sunday, September 27th are my own responsibility.

> Please let me know if this is acceptable.

Note that in the case of billable travel, the email should be made out to the client instead of the supervisor.

###Can I fly out to a different region (other than my home city) after my scheduled work has ended at my temporary duty station?  Conversely, can I fly in from a different region prior to when my scheduled work begins?

Victor will be meeting with a partner agency in person in late September.  He would like to stay a couple of days on the East Coast after his scheduled work time and take the train up to see a friend in New York.

This is acceptable.  You will need the approval of your supervisor.  Scenario #1 lays out how any time prior to, or immediately after scheduled work days at a temporary duty location, is fine, just make sure you have your supervisor’s approval.  Flying in or out of a region that is not the same as your temporary work stations is also ok.  What you need to understand:  The cost of your transportation from another region will be reimbursed based on the cost to fly from your original temporary duty station back to your home region.  Your total reimbursement will be based on the cost to fly directly from your home city to the temporary duty station.  If it is determined that the cost is actually lower, you are home free.  However, if the cost is determined to be higher, you are liable for the additional amount.  The  will be based on the city pairs program [click here](http://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/104512)

Sample Authorization Email:

> I am requesting Authorization to travel as follows:
>
> I would like to fly from SFO to DCA on Sunday September 27th.  I have verbally been approved to attend the 18F All Hands meeting on Monday September 28th and Tuesday September 29th.  I would also work the following two days Wednesday September 30th and Thursday October 1st collaborating with the DC Operations Team.  I request permission to remain the weekend on the East Coast, and to fly out from the New York City area on Sunday.  I understand I would be responsible for all my accommodations after my Thursday departure from the office and that my reimbursable airfare cost would be based on similar flights from DC area airport to my home airport, and not the actual cost of my return flight.

> Thank you.

Again, in the case of billable travel, the email should be made out to the client instead of the supervisor.

<a name="non-contract"></a>

### I found a flight that I like, but it’s not a government contract carrier. Can I still take it?

You may still take a non-contract flight under certain circumstances:

Space on a scheduled contract flight is not available in time to accomplish the purpose of your travel, or use of contract service would require you to incur unnecessary overnight lodging costs which would increase the total cost of the trip;
The contractor’s flight schedule is inconsistent with explicit policies of your Federal department or agency with regard to scheduling travel during normal working hours;
A non-contract carrier offers a lower fare to the general public that, if used, will result in a lower total trip cost to the Government (the combined costs of transportation, lodging, meals, and related expenses considered);
Note to paragraph (c): This exception does not apply if the contract carrier offers the same or lower fare and has seats available at that fare, or if the fare offered by the non-contract carrier is restricted to Government and military travelers performing official business and may be purchased only with a contractor-issued charge card, centrally billed account (e.g., YDG, MDG, QDG, VDG, and similar fares) or GTR where the two previous options are not available;
Cost effective rail service is available and is consistent with mission requirements; or
Smoking is permitted on the contract air carrier and the nonsmoking section of the contract aircraft is not acceptable to you.
Note 1 to §301-10.107: Any group of 10 or more passengers traveling together on the same day, on the same flight, for the same mission, requiring group integrity and identified as a group by the travel management service upon booking is not a mandatory user of the Government’s contract city-pair fares. For group travel, agencies are expected to obtain air passenger transportation service that is practical and cost effective to the Government.
Note 2 to §301-10.107: Contractors are not authorized to use contract city-pair fares to perform travel under their contracts.
Note 3 to §301-10.107: If the Government contract city-pair carrier offers a lower cost capacity-controlled coach class contract fare (MCA, QCA, VCA, etc.) in addition to the unrestricted coach class contract fares (YCA), the traveler should use the lower cost capacity-controlled fare when it is available and meet mission needs.

### What do I do differently when I book with AdTrav?

AdTrav can expedite the booking of your flight (if you are less than 3 days away from travel), but there are still a few actions that you need to complete in Concur.  [Note:  Online reservations are only $8.36 per reservation vs. $34.30 to speak to an AdTrav agent.  Once ticketed, should you need to make changes to your reservations, you will again be charged another $34.30.  You should only use an agent in extreme cases, such as less than three days notice to travel.]

**Note:** Dates of travel should be confirmed in this e-mail, including any extension of travel for personal reasons. This includes, but is not limited to:

* Extending your stay in your travel location for the weekend before or following a trip (or for additional workdays in which your travel is not essential).

* 18F will pay for the cost of your flight on an alternative date but not your meals or lodging for those additional days.

* Flying to your travel location from another place that is not your home city and/or flying from your travel location to another place that is not your home city.

* 18F will pay for a flight that is equal to or less than in price to the least expensive compliant flight between your home city and travel location. For flights that are more expensive, you are responsible for the difference in price.
