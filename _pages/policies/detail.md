title: Detailing to and from 18F
---

A detail is when a person in one agency goes to work at another agency on a temporary, time-specific, and limited basis.

## Details out to external agencies

### Can staff from 18F detail to other federal agencies?

18F can detail individuals to other agencies, however, because of 18F’s financial model (in which we’re required to recover our costs under the authority of the Acquisition Services Fund), a detail is an exception to our general policy of not detailing individuals to other agencies. In general, we enter into agreements with agencies to complete projects, even if the project requires only one staff member to complete. The terms of that arrangement are spelled out under an Interagency Agreement that 18F and the agency agree to, and the agency reimburses 18F for the full-time cost of the individual, which includes salary, benefits, and 18F indirect costs. In some cases, the Executive Director of 18F may approve arrangements that are not reimbursed by the other agency, or involve other special circumstances determined on a case by case basis.

### What if an external agency approaches me or 18F about a detail opportunity?

A prerequisite for any work with an agency is that there must be an active IAA with the requesting agency for a specific project. If there is not an existing IAA, the first step is to establish one. To get that process started, contact Jay Finch, Director of Agency Partnerships.

If seeking an exception to the general rule of not doing details, contact your chapter or business unit director.  If approved by your chapter or business unit director, the director will contact Josh Bailes to coordinate approvals. 

## Details in from external agencies

### Can staff from other federal agencies detail into 18F?

Yes. Staff from other agencies can join our team for a specific period of time to work on projects that will ultimately benefit the external agency. This kind of arrangement can be done on a **reimbursable basis**, where 18F pays for the detailee’s salary and benefits, or on a **non-reimbursable basis** where 18F does not pay the other agency back.

In either scenario, **project leads must inform chapter directors of the request at the earliest stages**.

For **non-reimbursable details**, the lending agency must provide a memo of justification demonstrating that the work performed by the detailee (while with 18F) will ultimately benefit the lending agency.

In both cases, staff detailing in will need to devote 100 percent of their time to the project they’re assigned over the length of the detail.

When detailing staff in, it’s important to connect them to our organization in a meaningful way. That means they’ll be onboarded in the same way we bring in new hires, and welcomed into the chapter model either formally or informally. The idea is to connect them to peers for support and discussion.

Using the product chapter as an example, a detailee could be informally associated with this unit. Detailees are encouraged to attend product team meetings, chat with the team in the #product Slack channel, and even sometimes help with interviewing. There are a small number of activities limited to people who are formally aligned to the product team (for example, advice on how to deal with sensitive work situations). In those cases, there is a private Slack channel for those limited conversations that details likely won’t participate in.

## Time increments

Details agreements come in increments of 120 days or less (per GSA order HRM P 9334.1), and can be extended up to two times for a total period of no more than one year. All details must be approved by the receiving unit head, for example, an 18F business unit or chapter director, and GSA Office of General Council.

Once approved, the receiving unit head will complete the [18F detail request form](https://docs.google.com/a/gsa.gov/forms/d/18F2xfXUwiaLkBRJYov53OnjJ4_lMX0QBlTJ_tV9cojw/viewform) and ping [Cristina Brydges](https://18f.slack.com/team/cristina).

## Security Verification

All Federal employees working at GSA must have a security clearance. For those employees detailing into 18F from outside of GSA, their security status must be verified with the GSA Security Office. It is the responsibility of the 18F employee supervising the detailee to ensure this is complete. 18F Talent provides step-by-step instructions on how to complete the security process. This process should be completed at the same time as the detail agreement process.

## Offboarding

Once the assignment is complete, the detailee will work with their project lead to transition out and return any 18F equipment or software procured during their time with us. See [leaving 18F](/leaving-18f/) for more information about offboarding.
