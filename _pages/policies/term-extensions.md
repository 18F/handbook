This guide covers how to extend your time at 18F after two years.

## Background

Most employees at 18F are hired on term appointments under the Schedule A direct hiring authority, which sets a limit of two years for the initial period of employment with the option to renew for up to two additional years for a maximum term of four years (time as a PIF counts towards your four years).

## Renew your term

Connect with your supervisors six months before your initial two-year term expires to discuss your options. If you don’t know when your term ends, you can look in CHRIS for your “Assignment NTE Date.” Considerations for renewal include organizational priorities, position needs, and your individual performance to date.

You will not go through a new performance review when renewing your term, but your supervisor will look at your previous performance reviews. It’s not automatic either way, but generally if you’ve received a three or higher on a review then you can be renewed.

Renewals are also based on 18F’s needs. As you all know, right now we need everyone we can get, but in the future it’s possible that the need filled by some positions may be resolved in two years. The real goal for this renewal process is to get you and your supervisor talking. If you both agree that you’d like to stay on and you’re needed, then you’re good to go. If not, it’s good to have this conversation well before your term date so everyone is on the same page about the best way to move forward.

Once you and your supervisor mutually agree that it is or is not in 18F's best interest to renew your engagement, your supervisor should alert the Talent Team by emailing Cristina Brydges.

If the decision is to renew, the Talent Team will process a Request for Personnel Action (RPA) to extend your term. Please note that you do not have to renew for the full two years; you could renew for less time (such as 1 year, 6 months, or 1 month). Your employment status and benefits will remain the same and no additional action is needed from you or your supervisor.

At this point, the renewal process is completed by the Talent Team and GSA HR.

1. Supervisor approves the extension and submits an email to the Talent Team.
2. Approved extensions are placed on a tracking list.
3. Shawnique Muller sends the extension RPAs (RPAs are submitted and processed through CHRIS) in batches at the beginning of each month for all extensions happening the following month.
4. HR reviews and confirms the RPA checking that all information is accurate (employee has another term left, correct extension dates).
  - *Note: New Term beginning dates are the following day from the previous term end date excluding weekends. If it’s a weekend it will be the following Monday. New Term end dates will be the Friday if it falls on a weekend.*
5. HR sends the approved RPA to CPC (Consolidated Processing Center in Kansas City, MO) to have it processed.
6. CPC processes the RPA. They process all approved personnel actions in GSA systems and complete the SF50, which is attached to your personnel record and can be viewed in CHRIS. They process RPAs based on action date, which is why you will not see the updates in CHRIS until the extension date.

Please note that GSA and the systems do not process extensions ahead of time.

Your updated NTE (Not To Exceed date) will show up in your CHRIS account under the “Assignment Tab” on the day of the renewal along with your updated SF50 under the “Personnel Actions (SF-50s)” tab, so on 8/25/16 you would see the new date of 8/25/18. A notification from the CHRIS system usually gets emailed to employees up to two weeks after the action.

We realize not seeing the extension in the system until the date it happens is not very comforting, but please know these have been moving along smoothly to date.

If the decision is not to renew, the Talent Team will process an RPA to end your term at the end of the initial two years. See [Leaving 18F](/leaving-18f) for more details.
