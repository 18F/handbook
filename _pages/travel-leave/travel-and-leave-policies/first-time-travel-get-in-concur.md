There are four required steps to gain access to [Concur](http://travel.gsa.gov/).

1. To access [Concur](http://travel.gsa.gov/), you will need a **“travel vendor ID”**. Use the [Vendor Request Management site](https://finance.ocfo.gsa.gov/VendorRequest/co/Stepd.aspx) to request a new vendor ID. Please note that you'll need to be on the VPN to access this site. 
  * In case the travel finance team is unable to locate your payroll banking information, they may request that you complete [the EFT form](https://drive.google.com/a/gsa.gov/file/d/0B0Kck5dqF_Ebb0FFZ29RR0JmVVk/view?usp=sharing) and will provide instructions on how you can send this information to them securely.
  * While you wait for the ID number to be generated and sent to you via email (which can take up to 1 business day), you may get started on [applying for the GSA travel card]({{site.baseurl}}/first-time-travel-travel-card).

2. Take the 2019 GSA Mandatory Cyber Security and Privacy Training in [OLU](https://gsaolu.gsa.gov). This can take several hours. Follow the instructions [here]({{site.baseurl}}/olu/#help-with-olu) if you need help.

3. Complete the [CGE Access Request Form](https://drive.google.com/a/gsa.gov/file/d/0B0Kck5dqF_EbM3ZRaHRqRHFWSzA/view?usp=sharing), minus the EFT enrollment form. Either an electronic or ink signature is fine. Don't forget to get your supervisor's signature as well!

4. Email completed CGE form to [tts-travel@gsa.gov](mailto:tts-travel@gsa.gov). _Do not email it to cge-access-requests@gsa.gov,_ as the form specifies. Only email it to tts-travel@gsa.gov. Your account will be set up before [the next travel office hours](https://sites.google.com/a/gsa.gov/tts-office-hours/), which you can also book any time if you have questions.
