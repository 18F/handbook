## Brief overview of vouchers

You may be reimbursed for your expenses from official travel, or any other approved expense paid for via personal funds (such as reimbursement for [local travel]({{site.baseurl}}/travel-guide-faq/#how-do-i-create-a-local-or-miscellaneous-voucher), or [professional liability insurance]({{site.baseurl}}/travel-guide-faq/#how-can-i-get-reimbursed-for-professional-liability-insurance) for supervisors) by creating a voucher in [Concur](https://travel.gsa.gov).

You can get started by navigating to the **Vouchers** tab on top and selecting **New Voucher**. If you do not yet have access to Concur, you can request it by [following these steps]({{site.baseurl}}/first-time-travel-get-in-concur).

BEFORE YOU BEGIN: _did your dates of travel change such that they are in any way outside of the original dates of your trip? If yes, STOP, and create an [amended authorization]({{site.baseurl}}/travel-guide-a-amended-authorizations) for the new dates._

* Any travel that involves a flight, Amtrak, or is otherwise over 12 hours in duration is considered a **[Voucher From Authorization]({{site.baseurl}}/travel-guide-faq/#how-do-i-create-a-voucher-from-authorization)**.
* For any other reimbursement, including local travel, or reimbursement of expenses unrelated to travel, such as professional liability insurance, choose the **[Local voucher]({{site.baseurl}}/travel-guide-faq/#how-do-i-create-a-local-or-miscellaneous-voucher)** option. Ensure that [an email from your authorizing official]({{site.baseurl}}/travel-guide-faq/#how-to-secure-authorizing-official-approval) approving the expenses you intend to get reimbursed has been sent to tts-travelauths@gsa.gov.

Once the voucher is created, the next step is to enter and edit expenses in the **Expenses and Receipts** tab of the voucher. [Find out how to add, edit, and delete expenses]({{site.baseurl}}/travel-guide-faq/#how-to-add-edit-or-delete-expenses)

Different types of expenses have different requirements. Some can be claimed without further action needed, while others require receipts and/or a brief justification. [Review requirements for different types of expenses]({{site.baseurl}}/travel-guide-faq/#when-are-receipts-or-further-justifications-required-to-claim-expenses).

Finally, don't forget to [stamp and submit for travel team approval!]({{site.baseurl}}/travel-guide-faq/#how-to-stamp-and-submit-for-travel-team-approval) Your voucher will be reviewed in 3-5 business days, and reimbursement will be credited to your bank account and travel card 3-5 business days after approval.
