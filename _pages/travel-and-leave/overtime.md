This Handbook page provides a brief overview of overtime, comp time, and credit hours.

There are several factors which affect how you could be compensated for working extra hours. One is your salary: if your salary is at - or close to - the maximum GS salary ($176,300 in FY22). Another factor is whether you are an [exempt or non-exempt employee](https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/WHD/legacy/files/fs17a_overview.pdf).

You should obtain supervisor approval prior to working extra hours. And, your supervisor should understand your specific situation prior to approving overtime.

The guidance below is only a high level overview. You and/or your supervisor can reach out to PeopleOps anytime with questions about your specific situation.

## Overtime and Comp Time

Overtime and comp time can be approved by your supervisor no matter what type of [work schedule](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mz2QNcy5GDITEZ1FFKG_gRlyPRTygYLiGsYWPJ6zXjA/edit#) you have.

Overtime is when you are paid for extra hours that you work, whereas comp time is when you receive hours of leave instead of pay.

You should use your accrued comp time before using Annual Leave. However, if the end of the leave year is approaching, your supervisor can approve your Annual Leave requests first if you are in danger of losing Annual Leave because of “[Use or Lose]({{site.baseurl}}/travel-and-leave/leave/#annual-leave).”

Comp time expires one year (26 pay periods) after it is earned. When you reach the expiration date:

- If you are exempt: you will forfeit the leave.
- If you are non-exempt: you will be paid out the hours (at the overtime pay rate that was in effect when you earned the hours).

If you leave GSA, your comp time will follow the parameters above: either forfeited or paid out, depending on your exemption status.

## Credit Hours

Note: Credit hours are only available if you are on a [flexible work schedule](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mz2QNcy5GDITEZ1FFKG_gRlyPRTygYLiGsYWPJ6zXjA/edit#heading=h.pzfowma3jb4c).

You can be approved for credit hours if you want to voluntarily work additional hours to your normal/approved schedule. If you are required to work additional hours, you will receive overtime or comp time.

- You can have up to 24 credit hours accrued, at any given time.
- The hours will rollover from one pay period to the next, and they never expire.
- Credit hours cannot be converted to cash, unless you leave GSA (then they will be paid out).

### Credit hours example

You are on a [Gliding schedule](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mz2QNcy5GDITEZ1FFKG_gRlyPRTygYLiGsYWPJ6zXjA/edit#heading=h.jg1qatn3okhs), and you work 8 hours every day. You are not required to stay late, but you are in a productive headspace and want to work an extra hour to finish your project. You can talk to your supervisor and ask to work 1 more hour, therefore receiving 1 credit hour. You will need to request the 1 hour in HR Links, and your supervisor will need to approve it.

## Entering the overtime, comp time, and/or credit hours you will be working into HRLinks

You need to enter your overtime, comp time, or credit hours into HRLinks. Your supervisor will be notified to approve the hours.

- Click on the **Employee Time Requests** tile
- Select **Additional Time Requests**
- Click time request type (**Overtime**, **Comp Time**, or **Credit Time**)
- Select **Additional Time Type**
- Enter **Start Date** and **End Date**
- Enter **Requested Hours**
- Enter **Comments**
- Click **Submit**

You’ll receive emails after submitting the request, and after it is approved.

## Using the comp time and/or credit hours you’ve earned

You will submit a [leave request]({{site.baseurl}}/travel-and-leave/leave/#entering-a-leave-request), just like you do for other types of leave. When searching in HR Links for the leave type to request, the codes and leave names are:

- `041 - Comp Time Used`
- `037 - Credit Hours Used`
