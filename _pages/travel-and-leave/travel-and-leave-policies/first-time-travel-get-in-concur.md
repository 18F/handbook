There are four required steps to gain access to [Concur](https://travel.gsa.gov/). Please be aware, you cannot access the Cybersecurity & Privacy Training in OLU until after you are set up in HRLinks, which can take up to a week. If immediate travel is required, [tts-travel@gsa.gov](mailto:tts-travel@gsa.gov) can assist until your account is active.

1. To access [Concur](https://travel.gsa.gov/), you will need a **“travel vendor ID”**. Use the [Vendor Request Management site](https://finance.ocfo.gsa.gov/VendorRequest/co/Stepd.aspx) to request a new vendor ID. Please note that you'll need to be on the VPN to access this site.

**Vendor Request Instructions**

_You may experience slow page loads of about 30–60 seconds. This is not likely an issue with your internet._

- To get started, in the radio buttons under "Service Office", select "Traveler". Then, under "ADD VENDOR/ADDR CODE", click the "CLICK HERE" button.
- For Point of Contact / POC fields, enter the contact information for your supervisor.
- For "Service Divison", select "FAS" since TTS is under FAS.
- Once you complete the form and submit, you might see an error like `Application error occured while saving the information to the database: Error getting next Request ID from database - Connect Timeout expired.` If this occurs, continue submitting until you receive a successful confirmation message.

In case the travel finance team is unable to locate your payroll banking information, they may request that you complete [the EFT form](https://drive.google.com/a/gsa.gov/file/d/0B0Kck5dqF_Ebb0FFZ29RR0JmVVk/view?usp=sharing) and will provide instructions on how you can send this information to them securely.

While you wait for the ID number to be generated and sent to you via email (which can take up to 1 business day), you may get started on [applying for the GSA travel card]({{site.baseurl}}/first-time-travel-travel-card).

2. Take the 2019 GSA Mandatory Cyber Security and Privacy Training in [OLU](https://gsaolu.gsa.gov). This can take several hours. Follow the instructions [here]({{site.baseurl}}/training-and-development/olu/#help-with-olu) if you need help.

3. Complete the [CGE Access Request Form](https://drive.google.com/a/gsa.gov/file/d/0B0Kck5dqF_EbM3ZRaHRqRHFWSzA/view?usp=sharing), minus the EFT enrollment form. Either an electronic or ink signature is fine. Don't forget to get your supervisor's signature as well! \*_Not sure about a particular field? Get help by reading the_ [_FAQ below_](#frequently-asked-questions)

4. Email completed CGE form to [tts-travel@gsa.gov](mailto:tts-travel@gsa.gov). _Do not email it to cge-access-requests@gsa.gov,_ as the form specifies. Only email it to tts-travel@gsa.gov. Your account will be set up before [the next travel office hours](https://sites.google.com/a/gsa.gov/tts-office-hours/), which you can also book any time if you have questions.
