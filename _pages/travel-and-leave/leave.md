This page provides instructions for entering leave requests (also known as absence requests) in [HR Links](https://corporateapps.gsa.gov/hr-links/) and information on the various types of leave.

You can also see your remaining leave balances in HR Links (shows up to the right while making a vacation request) and in your leave balance on your paystub in [Employee Express]({{site.baseurl}}/getting-started/classes/gsa-internal-tools/#employee-express).

### HR Links tips

- If you're having issues with logging into HR Links while using Google Chrome, please use these [instructions to clear your site cache](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13j6e8bAVSWFSNNkqmU2hMfwXOCBsi49d_2EqvL3aKXE/edit?usp=sharing)
- Partial day requests cannot be made in the middle of a multi-day request; more than one request will need to be made
- AWS schedules are automatically factored into HR Links timekeeping
- ETAMS/reconciliation is no longer needed because time off requests and time cards are linked in HR Links
- Leave Without Pay (LWOP) can be requested in HR Links
- Court leave can be requested in HR Links;
- Clicking Absence/OT history shows all requests
- HRLinks does not always reflect accurate leave balances, it is recommended to track your leave outside of the official record in addition to submitting your leave in HRLinks. [Federalretirement.net](https://www.federalretirement.net/leave-record.htm) has an easy to use spreadsheet that employees may use as a back up to HRLinks.

## Leave

Employees must report to work or have leave approved every scheduled work day. Leave requests should be submitted to your supervisor in [HR Links](https://corporateapps.gsa.gov/hr-links/) at least three business days in advance. Requests should be submitted for any duration of leave, as little as one hour.

Should an unforeseen emergency or illness arise requiring the use of leave not previously approved, contact your supervisor no later than two hours after the start of your typical work day to request permission for the absence. Unless other arrangements were made, requests for annual or sick leave must be made on each day of absence. Failure to properly request leave in accordance with this procedure may result in the denial of leave and a charge of absence without leave (AWOL), and may be the basis for disciplinary action. Absence without leave is an absence from duty that is not authorized or approved.

### Leave checklist

Before taking leave, be sure to:

- Submit leave through [HR Links](https://corporateapps.gsa.gov/hr-links/)
- Notify your supervisor of the dates. Also notify your Engagement Manager, Account Manager, and project lead if applicable.
- Mark your out of office time on your calendar and any applicable team or project calendars. Remember to set the permissions of the event to "public" so that people can see it's OOO time, rather than just seeing "busy."
- Tell team members or partners via Slack or email, and make sure work is covered
- Set up an email autoresponder as appropriate. This should include both when you’ll be back and a point of contact/team email for while you’re out. For example: `I am out of the office on Wednesday January 2nd and will respond to your request when I return on Thursday the 3rd. If you need immediate assistance please email 18F-PartnerSolutions@gsa.gov and your request will be directed to the appropriate party.`
- Consider reminding yourself to update your status on return. You can tell Slackbot `/remind me to “Update my OOO reminder per {{site.baseurl}}/leave/#returning-from-leave” on [date you return]`

- 18F team members should also:
  - Submit [correct Tock entries]({{site.baseurl}}/tools/tock/#tocking-for-out-of-office-time)
  - Update your Slack username and profile (ex: `@username | OOO until 7/12 | she`)
  - Create an event on the [18F Out of Office Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=gsa.gov_bth7useo0eeiicjgos2di6ph8k%40group.calendar.google.com) (TTS Ops uses it to support on-time Tocking)
  - Decline, cancel, or reschedule any meetings you'll miss
  - Product chapter members: add an event to the [All Things Product](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=gsa.gov_dkgkep8b6fj5ge1s2m0cn4srog%40group.calendar.google.com) calendar.

### Returning from leave

Upon returning from leave, remember to:

- Change your Slack name/status back to normal
- Turn off your email auto-response

### Annual leave

An employee may use annual leave for vacations, rest and relaxation, and personal business or emergencies. Annual leave accrues based on how long you've worked for the government:

- Fewer than 3 years: 4 hours per pay period
- Between 3 and 15 years: 6 hours per pay period
- 15+ years: 8 hours per pay period

The maximum annual leave that can be carried over is 240 hours, and if you've transferred to TTS from another federal agency, your accrued annual leave will transfer with you. (It may take between two and four pay periods before Employee Express will display your accrued annual leave.) More information is available on [OPM's Pay and Leave website](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/leave-administration/fact-sheets/annual-leave/).

#### Use or Lose

Use or Lose is the number of Annual Leave hours you would forfeit at the end of the leave year, if you do not use any of your Annual Leave hours between now and then. As noted above, there is a 240 hour limit on the number of hours you can carry over from one leave year to the next.

For example: You look in HRLinks and see "182 Hours (96 Hours Use or Lose)." Today, January 25th, 2022, you have 182 hours of Annual Leave available. If you continued to accrue Annual Leave for the rest of the year, and you did not use any of those hours, you would forfeit 96 hours of Annual Leave at the end of the year. You would be 96 hours over the 240 cap.

182 current hours + 154 more hours accrued throughout the year = 336 hours.

336 hours - 240 hour cap = 96 Use or Lose hours that would be forfeited.

### Sick leave

All federal employees, no matter how long they have worked, accrue four hours of sick leave per pay period. There is no maximum amount of sick leave you can accrue, and if you've transferred to TTS from another federal agency, your accrued sick leave will transfer with you. (It may take between two and four pay periods before Employee Express will display your accrued sick leave.) More information is available on [OPM's Pay and Leave website](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/leave-administration/fact-sheets/annual-leave/).

### Funeral leave

Employees can take 3 days (24 hours) of funeral leave to plan or attend services of an immediate relative who has suffered a combat-related death. Additionally, veterans can take funeral leave to participate in a funeral ceremony for a member of the Armed Forces.

Employees can take up to 13 days (104 hours) per year of sick leave for bereavement, funeral planning, and/or attending the funeral of a family member.

Further funeral leave information can be found in OPM's Fact Sheets:

- [Leave for funerals and bereavement](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/leave-administration/fact-sheets/leave-for-funerals-and-bereavement/)
- [Sick leave for family care or bereavement purposes](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/leave-administration/fact-sheets/sick-leave-for-family-care-or-bereavement-purposes/)
- [Definitions related to family member and immediate relative for purposes of sick leave](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/leave-administration/fact-sheets/definitions-related-to-family-member-and-immediate-relative-for-purposes-of-sick-leave/)

### Military leave

The [OPM military leave fact sheet](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/pay-administration/fact-sheets/military-leave/) states that any full-time Federal civilian employee whose appointment is not limited to one year is entitled to military leave. Military leave under 5 U.S.C. 6323(a) is prorated for part-time career employees and employees on an uncommon tour of duty. 5 U.S.C. 6323 (a) provides 15 days per fiscal year for active duty, active duty training, and inactive duty training. An employee can carry over a maximum of 15 days into the next fiscal year.

Refer to the GSA [Time and Leave Policy](https://insite.gsa.gov/cdnstatic/insite/HRM_60101_Time_and_Leave_Administration_Policy_%28Posted_Version_-_March_23%2C_2020%29.pdf) and contact the [FAS Benefits Specialist](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15glvq9UakKUN8XTRTa6gRkhBHm2whhQyAGmf8ibTtBs/edit) who corresponds to your last name to let them know if you have military orders.

### Disabled veteran leave (DVL)

A veteran with a service-connected disability rating of 30 percent or more from the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) of the Department of Veterans Affairs is entitled to up to 104 hours of disabled veteran leave for the purposes of undergoing medical treatment for such disability.

The employee will have a single, continuous 12-month eligibility period, beginning on the “first day of employment” in which to use the leave or it will be **forfeited with no opportunity to carry over** the leave into subsequent years.

For additional information, please reference the [Disabled Veteran Fact Sheet on opm.gov](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/leave-administration/fact-sheets/disabled-veteran-leave/).

## Extended leave

### Unpaid leave

Unpaid leave, also called Leave Without Pay (LWOP), is exactly what it sounds like. Employees can request unpaid leave of less than four weeks at any time. To take a leave of absence without pay, you'll need justification, supervisory oversight, and, for longer terms, supervisory approval.

- [Fact Sheet: Effect of Extended Leave Without Pay (LWOP) (or Other Nonpay Status) on Federal Benefits and Programs](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/leave-administration/fact-sheets/effect-of-extended-leave-without-pay-lwop-or-other-nonpay-status-on-federal-benefits-and-programs/)

- **TTS Process for requesting LWOP**
  Employee must get written approval from the following chain of command:

  1. Immediate Supervisor
  1. Business Unit Director
  1. Assistant Commissioner

Once approvals are received, please submit a copy of the email thread to [TTS-peopleops@gsa.gov](mailto:tts-peopleops@gsa.gov)

### Federal Employee Paid Leave Act (Paid Parental Leave)

The Federal Employee Paid Leave Act (FEPLA) gives workers access to up to 12 weeks of paid time off for the birth, adoption or placement of a new child.
Paid Parental Leave (PPL) provides that an employee may substitute 12 administrative workweeks (480 hours) of paid parental leave for Family and Medical Leave Act leave.

#### Items that Employee needs to fill out and gather to request PPL:

1. [Paid Parental Leave Request form](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fKcnu4idW2BTpdb9GIXw8rlYySHoGzRf/view)
2. [Paid Parental Leave Service Agreement form](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zX9draOiQ456sssQ13qtSWBDwZpElVH5/view), and
3. On the Self-Service tile in [HR Links](https://corporateapps.gsa.gov/hr-links/), run a TRC report for FMLA for the prior calendar year
   - For assistance on running the report, reach out to tts-peopleops@gsa.gov
4. [Supporting documentation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bVEm_VjfW6w0jZZZxnhysOemURVv43Bd/view) to show childbirth, adoption, foster care.
   - In the event of a childbirth(s) or placement, employee can provide date of birth/placement to the [Workforce Relations HR Specialist](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15glvq9UakKUN8XTRTa6gRkhBHm2whhQyAGmf8ibTtBs/edit) for provisional approval with supporting documentation (outlined above) to follow

**NOTE:** PDF forms above should be downloaded and opened in Adobe Acrobat before filling out and saving

Return the first three items above to the [Workforce Relations HR Specialist](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15glvq9UakKUN8XTRTa6gRkhBHm2whhQyAGmf8ibTtBs/edit) who supports TTS. That Specialist can coordinate with the supervisor and recommend approval or not of the PPL.

As a reminder, employees need to be approved for PPL by their servicing [Workforce Relations HR Specialist](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15glvq9UakKUN8XTRTa6gRkhBHm2whhQyAGmf8ibTtBs/edit) before using PPL.

#### Entering Paid Parental Leave in HR Links

This [HR Links guide](https://corporateapps.gsa.gov/files/Paid-Parental-Leave-Employee-Job-Aid.pdf) has instructions on how to enter paid parental leave requests.

**_An employee is only entitled to up to 12 workweeks of unpaid leave during any 12-month period. If they previously used FMLA leave during the same 12 month period, this needs to be subtracted from the 480 hour entitlement._**

Annual Leave + Sick Leave: Employees are entitled to use their earned annual and sick leave for parental/maternity leave reasons. This would be _regular_ Annual Leave and _regular_ Sick Leave. Please note, though, that if these _regular_ leave options are used (without the FMLA extension), the PPL **cannot** be retroactively applied towards the parental/maternity leave.

For more assistance with parental leave, reach out in the [#parental-leave](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/messages/C1AA9J7B8/) channel.

### Family and Medical Leave Act

The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) allows most federal employees to take up to 12 weeks of **unpaid** leave per 12-month period for the following:

- The birth or care of a child
- An adoption or placement of child for foster care
- The care of a spouse/son/daughter/parent with a serious health condition
- A serious health condition of an employee
- A qualifying exigency from spouse, child or parent of an employee on covered active duty in the Armed Forces

An employee is entitled to taking FMLA when they have been an employee of the federal government for **at least 12 months.**

Former members of the military and/or a military service academy can receive credit for their time. They’ll need to fill out form [FERS 3108](https://www.opm.gov/forms/pdf_fill/sf3108.pdf). An employee who has transferred from another agency can use their time to count toward the 12-month restriction.

The Department of Labor has a [detailed guide to FMLA](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/fmla).

For complete details, see [this recent guidance](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/leave-administration/fact-sheets/handbook-on-leave-and-workplace-flexibilities-for-childbirth-adoption-and-foster-care.pdf).

For a human, readable summary:

Both parents may use their annual or sick leave after the birth of a child, for the period of the mother’s incapacitation. The length of the medically necessary leave is ultimately determined by a doctor’s note, but six weeks for a vaginal birth and eight weeks for a cesarean birth is common. After parents exhaust their annual and sick leave, they can run a sick leave deficit of up to the amount they will accrue during their tenure.

Employees may also apply for annual leave donations from other federal employees within their agency. Leave donations may only be used for a medically necessary leave period, as determined by the doctor's note. Leave donations from federal employees outside GSA are considered on a case-by-case basis. Additionally, if spouses are both employed by the federal government, they may donate unlimited annual leave to each other, regardless of the agencies they work for. Leave donations can be used to backfill sick leave and annual leave deficits.

If you'd like TTS to send out an email notifying your colleagues about your request for donated leave, [fill out this form](https://forms.gle/BmVKz5ByfW6XyYZ89). It's editable, so when you return to work you can fill in an end date.

In addition to the paid leave described above, employees can take leave without pay (under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA)) for up to 12 weeks per calendar year. Once you've been an employee of the federal government for at least 12 months, you're eligible to take FMLA, provided your supervisor approves it. You can take this leave within one year of the birth of your child. You do not need to take it all at once. Employees are eligible to take intermittent leave within the first year of their child’s birth. For instance, you could take unpaid leave on Tuesdays and Thursdays for several weeks in a row.

## Donating leave

Under the [Voluntary Leave Transfer Program](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/leave-administration/fact-sheets/voluntary-leave-transfer-program/) (VLTP), a covered employee may donate annual leave directly to another employee who has a personal or family medical emergency and who has exhausted their available paid leave. If you wish to donate annual leave, you will need to use MAX.gov to access the [VLTP](https://vltp.gsa.gov/) system following the steps below:

If your gsa.gov email address is not registered with MAX.gov, you will need to register at the OMB MAX.gov homepage:

- Select the "Register Now" button at the top right of that homepage and follow [these instructions](https://corporateapps.gsa.gov/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/VLTP_AccessLogin_2019.pdf) to register your PIV card and enable login (or use the email option if you don't yet have a PIV card reader)
- Go to [https://vltp.gsa.gov/](https://vltp.gsa.gov/) and follow the instructions below for registered users

If you are a registered MAX.gov user:

- Go to [https://vltp.gsa.gov/](https://vltp.gsa.gov/) and log in using your PIV card or GSA email with 2-factor authentication
- You will be taken to the GSA Payroll System VLTP page
- Click the button on the bottom to “Donate Annual Leave Hours To A Shared Leave Recipient”
- Follow the system prompts to donate leave (select "General Services Administration" as the agency and "0 - Central Office" as the region)

If you have any questions, please email our [Leave Policies contact](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15glvq9UakKUN8XTRTa6gRkhBHm2whhQyAGmf8ibTtBs/edit) in the Office of Human Resources Management. Also, don’t hesitate to ask in #parental-leave in Slack.

If the system gives you an error, try submitting through the [Citrix VDI]({{site.baseurl}}/tools/virtual-desktop/#logging-into-the-citrix-vdi) using Internet Explorer.

If the system is down, you can submit donation requests directly to Lakita Rivero (lakita.rivero@gsa.gov).

## Advanced leave

### Advanced annual leave

An employee may only take advanced annual leave in the amount they will earn back by the end of the current leave year, and the advanced leave may not exceed 80 hours.

Please note: You may receive an exception in HRLinks that "temporary appointment employees cannot be advanced annual leave." Policy allows the approval of advance leave for employees on limited appointments, but the amount of advance leave approved must not exceed the NTE or end of the leave year. The system will always give you an exception message when your leave balance is in the negative. When your supervisor goes into the system to approve your time, it is their responsibility to make a remark in the comment box noting their approval of advance leave.

![Screenshot reflecting negative leave balance exception]({{site.baseurl}}/images/leave/Advanced Leave timesheet exception.png)

You can find Leave Year beginning and end dates in this Office of Personnel Management (OPM) [fact sheet](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/leave-administration/fact-sheets/leave-year-beginning-and-ending-dates/).

### Advanced sick leave

In cases of serious disability or ailment, and when the exigencies of the situation so require, an employee may take advanced sick leave in an amount not to exceed 30 work days (240 hours). This advance may be granted whether or not the employee has any annual leave to their credit except where an application for disability retirement has been submitted to the Office of Personnel Management.

**For employees** **serving under a limited appointment (term appointments) or one which will be terminated on a specified date, they may be advanced sick leave up to the total amount of sick leave which would otherwise be earned during the term of that appointment.**

### Additional advanced leave resources

- [Fact Sheet: Advanced Sick Leave](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/leave-administration/fact-sheets/advanced-sick-leave/)
- [Insite: Advanced Sick Leave](https://insite.gsa.gov/portal/category/510090)

## Court leave (including jury duty)

- Authorized absence without charge to leave or pay
- Must be officially requested to serve in a judicial proceeding to which the Federal, a state, or local government is party
- Requests for time off due to jury duty can now be made in [HR Links](https://corporateapps.gsa.gov/hr-links/);

## Administrative leave

There are several other types of short-term leave available for reasons such as voting or blood donation. A more complete list of administrative leave reasons can be found [on Insite](https://insite.gsa.gov/topics/hr-pay-and-leave/pay-and-leave/leave/types-of-paid-leave#Other%20Types)

## Religious observance

Adjusting work schedules for religious observances is handled differently than leave. If you need to miss regular work hours for religious observance, you should notify your supervisor in writing in advance of the time you'll need to miss, along with the schedule of the time you will work outside of normal hours to compensate. For details, please see the relevant [OPM policy](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/work-schedules/fact-sheets/adjustment-of-work-schedules-for-religious-observances/).

## Time tracking

Billable TTS employees taking planned leave should follow guidance to [Tock when on leave]({{ site.baseurl }}/tools/tock/#tocking-for-out-of-office-time). For unplanned leave such as sudden illness or family emergency, do what you can to contact your supervisor, and they can help manage the rest on your behalf.

[HR Links](https://corporateapps.gsa.gov/hr-links/) is GSA's out of office request system and is separate from [Tock]({{ site.baseurl }}/tock), which is TTS' own timekeeping system. If you're taking time off, you'll need to make sure you're accounted for in both systems.

For more information on leave, see the [Benefits class]({{site.baseurl}}/getting-started/classes/benefits/) and the [GSA Tools and Equipment class]({{site.baseurl}}/getting-started/classes/gsa-internal-tools/).

## Transferring leave from another federal agency

Annual Leave and Sick Balances can take up to 3 pay periods to transfer to GSA depending on the speed of your previous payroll provider. If you have your final Earnings and Leave Statement available from your previous agency, you can send a copy to [kc-payroll.finance@gsa.gov](mailto:kc-payroll.finance@gsa.gov) to expedite the process.
