This page provides instructions for entering leave requests (also known as absence requests) in [HR Links](https://corporateapps.gsa.gov/hr-links/) and information on the various types of leave. The [leave overview chart](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-dm0tptMsZ2FKhuta52RFEiN4Sfkd9coYN0_tjQCe9Y/edit#gid=0) also provides a high level, visual comparison.

You can see your Annual, Award, and Sick Leave balances in HR Links and on your paystub in [Employee Express]({{site.baseurl}}/getting-started/classes/gsa-internal-tools/#employee-express).

GSA’s [Time and Leave Administration policy](https://insite.gsa.gov/directives-library/-time-and-leave-administration-policy-60101a-hrm) establishes agency-wide policy, procedures, and requirements for all employees. Additional fact sheet links are provided throughout this page, with the corresponding type of leave.

## Your overall responsibilities

You must report to work or have an approved leave request in HR Links, every scheduled work day.

You should submit leave requests at least three business days in advance, and make timely edits if your plans change.

For unplanned leave - such as a sudden illness or a family emergency - do what you can to contact your supervisor, and they can help manage the rest on your behalf.

Some types of leave require supporting documentation: it is your responsibility to submit all necessary documents and check that you’ve received approval. Various scenarios are documented below, along with contact information for help.

## Supervisor responsibilities

Supervisors have primary responsibility for administering leave policies and regulations.

They are accountable for the timesheet data submitted to GSA payroll each pay period: they are certifying that their direct reports’ work time and absences are recorded and reported accurately. This information is critical, as it affects pay and leave balances.
Supervisors should be reviewing and approving/denying leave requests on a regular and timely basis. They also need to review and approve timesheets every two weeks, as the pay period closes.

In TTS, supervisors receive support from PeopleOps, who serve as the organization’s timekeepers, and our [Workforce Relations HR Specialist](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15glvq9UakKUN8XTRTa6gRkhBHm2whhQyAGmf8ibTtBs/edit), who answers policy questions and will help process certain types of leave requests. However, supervisors are expected to be knowledgeable about time and leave policy, and to keep PeopleOps informed of any decisions/approvals made that would affect time and leave records.

If someone is unexpectedly OOO and cannot request leave in HR Links, supervisors can [enter a leave request on their behalf](https://corporateapps.gsa.gov/files/Create-an-Absence-Request-Supervisor.pdf).

If a supervisor is going out of office, their supervisor will typically handle HR Links tasks while they are gone: approving timesheets & leave requests, etc. However, a supervisor may run into a time where they want to delegate tasks to someone else (example: their direct supervisor is also OOO or that role is vacant). Here are three step-by-step guides for a supervisor to delegate approval responsibilities:

1. [Fact Sheet: Should I do a delegation? What can I delegate?](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Nxsl0pAg9sman4ntrQlBNPqcvFGaXrSJagV7HG-f27c/edit)

## Submitting leave in HR Links

### Logging into HR Links

You'll need to log in to [HR Links](https://corporateapps.gsa.gov/hr-links/) in order to submit a leave request. HR Links can only be accessed via VPN ([Citrix Workspace]({{site.baseurl}}/tools/virtual-desktop) and [Cisco AnyConnect]({{site.baseurl}}/anyconnect)) or on the wireless network at one of GSA’s offices.

### HR Links tips

- Partial day requests cannot be made in the middle of a multi-day request; more than one leave request will need to be submitted.
- AWS schedules are automatically factored into HR Links. For example: you won’t be able to request leave on your designated AWS “off day” because you aren’t scheduled to work that day.
- If you’re having issues logging into HR Links while using Google Chrome, please use these [instructions to clear your cache](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13j6e8bAVSWFSNNkqmU2hMfwXOCBsi49d_2EqvL3aKXE/edit?usp=sharing).

## Leave checklist
Before taking leave, be sure to:
- [Submit a leave request through HR Links]({{site.baseurl}}/travel-and-leave/leave/#submitting-leave-in-hr-links). Discuss the dates with your supervisor, as needed.
- Mark your out of office time on your calendar and any applicable team or project calendars.
  - [Google Calendar has an OOO setting](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/7638168?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&oco=0) that can auto-reject current and future meetings.
- Decline, cancel, or reschedule any meetings you’ll miss.
- Tell team members or partners via Slack or email, and make sure your work is covered.
  - Notify your Engagement Manager, Account Manager, and project lead, if applicable.
- Set up an email autoresponder as appropriate. This should include both when you’ll be back and a point of contact/team email for while you’re out. 
  - For example: `I am out of the office on Wednesday January 2nd and will respond to your request when I return on Thursday the 3rd. If you need immediate assistance please email [email address] and your request will be directed to the appropriate party.`
- Update your Slack status to indicate that you are OOO.
  - You can also [set up a Slackbot reminder](https://slack.com/help/articles/208423427-Set-a-reminder) to prompt you to turn off OOO statuses when you return: `/remind me to “Update my OOO reminder” on [date you return]`

- 18F team members should also:
- Submit [correct Tock entries]({{site.baseurl}}/tools/tock/#tocking-for-out-of-office-time)
  - Update your Slack username and profile (ex: `@username | OOO until 7/12 | she`)
  - Product chapter members: add an event to the [All Things Product](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=gsa.gov_dkgkep8b6fj5ge1s2m0cn4srog%40group.calendar.google.com) calendar.

### Returning from leave

Upon returning from leave, remember to:

- Change your Slack name/status back to normal
- Turn off your email auto-response

### Taking time off prior to your last day at TTS

If you are leaving the federal government, your final day at TTS must be worked in full, unless you have worked the majority of your final pay period; then you are eligible to take leave for part of your final day.

If you are taking a new role within the federal government, the above restrictions do not apply.

## Types of leave

### Annual leave

You may use annual leave for any reason. Annual leave accrues based on how long you’ve worked for the government:

- Fewer than 3 years: 4 hours per pay period
- Between 3 and 15 years: 6 hours per pay period
- 15+ years: 8 hours per pay period

You can carry over a maximum of 240 annual leave hours, from one [leave year](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/leave-administration/fact-sheets/leave-year-beginning-and-ending-dates/) to the next. If you’ve transferred to TTS from another federal agency, your accrued annual leave will transfer with you.

#### Use or Lose

Use or Lose is the number of annual leave hours you would forfeit at the end of the [leave year](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/leave-administration/fact-sheets/leave-year-beginning-and-ending-dates/), if you do not use any of your annual leave hours between now and then. As noted above, there is a 240 hour limit on the number of hours you can carry over from one leave year to the next.

For example: You look in HRLinks and see "182 Hours (96 Hours Use or Lose)." Today, January 25th, 2022, you have 182 hours of annual leave available. If you continued to accrue annual leave for the rest of the year, and you did not use any of those hours, you would forfeit 96 hours of annual leave at the end of the year. You would be 96 hours over the 240 cap.

182 current hours + 154 more hours accrued throughout the year = 336 hours.

336 hours - 240 hour cap = 96 Use or Lose hours that would be forfeited.

### Award leave

Award leave is offered for End of Year Performance Awards and Special Act Awards.

- If you are eligible for an [End of Year Performance Award]({{site.baseurl}}/performance-management/#who-is-eligible-for-the-end-of-year-performance-bonus), you can [opt-in via HRLinks](https://corporateapps.gsa.gov/files/TimeOffAwardPreference_JobAid-October-2020.pdf) to receive Award Leave in lieu of a monetary award.
- If you are receiving a TTS Special Act Award, you will be notified and asked for your preference of award leave or a monetary award.
 
You can receive a maximum of 80 hours of award leave in a single fiscal year. If you receive a Special Act Award after hitting the 80 hour cap, your award will be monetary.

Award leave expires one year after it is issued. Expired award leave cannot be recovered - please monitor your leave balances and consider using award leave first. If you leave TTS, award leave is not paid out.

#### Checking your Award Leave dates:

- Log-in to HR Links
- From the Employee Self-Service homepage, click on the **Print SF-50** tile
- You'll see a list of SF-50 documents
- In the **Action Reason** column, look for **Time Off Award** or **Special Act Time Off Award**
- Find the date in the **Effective Date** column
- Your award leave will expire one year after the listed effective date

You may receive an automated email reminder from HR Links 3 months before your leave expires, even if you have already used it.

OPM Policy:
- [Time-Off Awards](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/performance-management/performance-management-cycle/rewarding/time-off-awards/)

### Sick leave

All federal employees, no matter how long they have worked in government, accrue four hours of sick leave per pay period. There is no maximum amount of sick leave you can accrue, and if you've transferred to TTS from another federal agency, your accrued sick leave will transfer with you.

You can use sick leave for your physical and mental health needs. You can also use up to 13 days of sick leave per year for family health needs and bereavement.

If a family member has a serious health concern and you need to take more than 13 days for their care, you can apply for FMLA. If approved for FMLA, you can use up to 12 weeks of sick leave to care for your family member. However, FMLA is also used for Paid Parental Leave (PPL). Any amount of FMLA taken is subtracted from the total available to you for the next 12 months. You need to be a federal employee for at least 12 months in order to be entitled to FMLA. We **highly recommend** you discuss FMLA, your unique leave needs, and potential leave options with our [Workforce Relations HR Specialist](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15glvq9UakKUN8XTRTa6gRkhBHm2whhQyAGmf8ibTtBs/edit).

### Funeral leave

You can use up to 13 days (104 hours) per year of your sick leave for bereavement, funeral planning, and/or attending the funeral of a family member.

You can receive 3 days (24 hours) of funeral leave to plan or attend services of an immediate relative who has suffered a combat-related death. Additionally, veterans can take funeral leave to participate in a funeral ceremony for a member of the Armed Forces.

### Parental bereavement leave
You can receive two weeks (80 hours) of parental bereavement leave for the passing of your child. Contact our [Workforce Relations HR Specialist](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15glvq9UakKUN8XTRTa6gRkhBHm2whhQyAGmf8ibTtBs/edit) for assistance.

OPM Policy:
- [Parental Bereavement Leave Memorandum](https://chcoc.gov/content/parental-bereavement-leave)

### Military leave

You can receive 15 Military Leave days each year for active duty, active duty training, and inactive duty training in the National Guard or as a Reservist. You can carry over a maximum of 15 days into the next fiscal year. 

Military Leave will not appear in HR Links until *after* you have requested it for the first time. For a two-week annual training or any other first-use of your 15 paid days, request the leave using `Code 50 - Regular Military Leave`. You and your supervisor won’t see an available leave balance, and HR Links will show an error, but your timecard will process and the leave balance adjustment will be made by Payroll. 

#### Going on active duty
If you are called to active duty, no matter the length of time, contact the [FAS Benefits Specialist](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15glvq9UakKUN8XTRTa6gRkhBHm2whhQyAGmf8ibTtBs/edit) who corresponds to your last name. They can help with GSA’s [Checklist for Employees Entering Extended Active Duty](https://www.gsa.gov/forms-library/civilian-employees-entering-extended-active-duty-checklist).

### Disabled veteran leave (DVL)

If you are a veteran with a service-connected disability rating of 30 percent or more, you can receive up to 104 hours of disabled veteran leave to receive medical treatment related to your disability.

DVL is a one-time benefit: you have a single, 12-month eligibility period, beginning on the first day of your federal employment, in which to use the leave. After that period, it is forfeited with no opportunity to carry over hours.

OPM Fact Sheet:
- [Disabled Veteran Leave](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/leave-administration/fact-sheets/disabled-veteran-leave/)

### Weather and safety leave

You can receive ad hoc “Weather and Safety Leave” if you are prevented from safely working because of an unexpected event such as:
- Weather-related damage to your home that makes occupying the home unsafe
- Loss of power at home (which makes your home not an approved location under agency telework policies)
- Not being prepared for teleworking when the conditions could not be anticipated (tornado or earthquake)

Your safety is paramount. It is expected that when possible, you’ll communicate with your supervisor if you’re unexpectedly unable to work. Your supervisor is responsible for approving/denying your Weather and Safety Leave request; they can work with our [Workforce Relations HR Specialist](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15glvq9UakKUN8XTRTa6gRkhBHm2whhQyAGmf8ibTtBs/edit) if they have questions on whether it is appropriate to approve the request.

If a supervisor doesn’t hear from you, and suspects you are facing a weather/safety issue, they should try contacting you as well as notifying our [Workforce Relations HR Specialist](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15glvq9UakKUN8XTRTa6gRkhBHm2whhQyAGmf8ibTtBs/edit) so there’s a record that you may be affected by a weather event.

This leave is entered in HR Links under Administrative Leave `Code 094 - Weather & Safety`. You should include a reason in the `Comments/History` section: for example, `Cook County evacuation order of 9/10/20`. Supervisors can enter the request if you are unable to access HR Links.

### EAP referrals
The [Employee Assistance Program (EAP)]({{site.baseurl}}/getting-started/classes/benefits/#employee-assistance-program) is a free support resource available to all GSA federal employees. The EAP offers sessions with licensed or credentialed counselors on a variety of topics, including stress, grief, financial issues, addiction, and more.

Supervisors who believe their direct report could benefit from the EAP can make a referral and allow up to 4 hours of work time to be used for pursuing EAP assistance. Supervisors can make informal referrals (verbal), and formal referrals (written, associated with job performance or conduct issues). The EAP publishes a [Supervisor’s Guide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uYJ3cWUc3HLUUm5f7baFt_uUpz_-CyIG/view) with detailed information.

## Extended leave

### Unpaid leave

Unpaid leave, also called Leave Without Pay (LWOP), is exactly what it sounds like. Employees can request unpaid leave of less than four weeks at any time. To take a leave of absence without pay, you'll need justification, supervisory oversight, and, for longer terms, supervisory approval.

- [Fact Sheet: Effect of Extended Leave Without Pay (LWOP) (or Other Nonpay Status) on Federal Benefits and Programs](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/leave-administration/fact-sheets/effect-of-extended-leave-without-pay-lwop-or-other-nonpay-status-on-federal-benefits-and-programs/)

- **TTS Process for requesting LWOP**
  Employee must get written approval from the following chain of command:

  1. Immediate Supervisor
  1. Business Unit Director
  1. Assistant Commissioner

Once approvals are received, please submit a copy of the email thread to [TTS-peopleops@gsa.gov](mailto:tts-peopleops@gsa.gov)

### Federal Employee Paid Leave Act (Paid Parental Leave)

The Federal Employee Paid Leave Act (FEPLA) gives workers access to up to 12 weeks of paid time off for the birth, adoption or placement of a new child.
Paid Parental Leave (PPL) provides that an employee may substitute 12 administrative workweeks (480 hours) of paid parental leave for Family and Medical Leave Act leave.

#### Items that Employee needs to fill out and gather to request PPL:

1. [Paid Parental Leave Request form](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fKcnu4idW2BTpdb9GIXw8rlYySHoGzRf/view)
2. [Paid Parental Leave Service Agreement form](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zX9draOiQ456sssQ13qtSWBDwZpElVH5/view), and
3. Within the Self-Service view in [HR Links](https://hrlinks.gsa.gov/), select the "Employee Reports" tile. From there, select "Time Sheet Reports," enter the dates for the prior calendar year and select "Run." A new tab with a downloadable PDF will open. (If you do not have the Employee Reports tile, you can also navigate there as follows: Select the compass icon in the top right of the navigation bar, select "Navigator" > Self Service" > "Time Sheet Report."
   - For assistance on running the report, reach out to tts-peopleops@gsa.gov
4. [Supporting documentation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bVEm_VjfW6w0jZZZxnhysOemURVv43Bd/view) to show childbirth, adoption, foster care.
   - In the event of a childbirth(s) or placement, employee can provide date of birth/placement to the [Workforce Relations HR Specialist](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15glvq9UakKUN8XTRTa6gRkhBHm2whhQyAGmf8ibTtBs/edit) for provisional approval with supporting documentation (outlined above) to follow

**NOTE:** PDF forms above should be downloaded and opened in Adobe Acrobat before filling out and saving

Return the first three items above to the [Workforce Relations HR Specialist](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15glvq9UakKUN8XTRTa6gRkhBHm2whhQyAGmf8ibTtBs/edit) who supports TTS. That Specialist can coordinate with the supervisor and recommend approval or not of the PPL.

As a reminder, employees need to be approved for PPL by their servicing [Workforce Relations HR Specialist](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15glvq9UakKUN8XTRTa6gRkhBHm2whhQyAGmf8ibTtBs/edit) before using PPL.

#### Entering Paid Parental Leave in HR Links

This [HR Links guide](https://corporateapps.gsa.gov/files/Paid-Parental-Leave-Employee-Job-Aid.pdf) has instructions on how to enter paid parental leave requests.

**_An employee is only entitled to up to 12 workweeks of unpaid leave during any 12-month period. If they previously used FMLA leave during the same 12 month period, this needs to be subtracted from the 480 hour entitlement._**

Annual Leave + Sick Leave: Employees are entitled to use their earned annual and sick leave for parental/maternity leave reasons. This would be _regular_ Annual Leave and _regular_ Sick Leave. Please note, though, that if these _regular_ leave options are used (without the FMLA extension), the PPL **cannot** be retroactively applied towards the parental/maternity leave.

For more assistance with parental leave, reach out in the [#parental-leave](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/messages/C1AA9J7B8/) channel.

### Family and Medical Leave Act

The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) allows most federal employees to take up to 12 weeks of **unpaid** leave per 12-month period for the following:

- The birth or care of a child
- An adoption or placement of child for foster care
- The care of a spouse/son/daughter/parent with a serious health condition
- A serious health condition of an employee
- A qualifying exigency from spouse, child or parent of an employee on covered active duty in the Armed Forces

An employee is entitled to taking FMLA when they have been an employee of the federal government for **at least 12 months.**

Former members of the military and/or a military service academy can receive credit for their time. They’ll need to fill out form [FERS 3108](https://www.opm.gov/forms/pdf_fill/sf3108.pdf). An employee who has transferred from another agency can use their time to count toward the 12-month restriction.

The Department of Labor has a [detailed guide to FMLA](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/fmla).

For complete details, see [this recent guidance](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/leave-administration/fact-sheets/handbook-on-leave-and-workplace-flexibilities-for-childbirth-adoption-and-foster-care.pdf).

For a human, readable summary:

Both parents may use their annual or sick leave after the birth of a child, for the period of the mother’s incapacitation. The length of the medically necessary leave is ultimately determined by a doctor’s note, but six weeks for a vaginal birth and eight weeks for a cesarean birth is common. After parents exhaust their annual and sick leave, they can run a sick leave deficit of up to the amount they will accrue during their tenure.

Employees may also apply for annual leave donations from other federal employees within their agency. Leave donations may only be used for a medically necessary leave period, as determined by the doctor's note. Leave donations from federal employees outside GSA are considered on a case-by-case basis. Additionally, if spouses are both employed by the federal government, they may donate unlimited annual leave to each other, regardless of the agencies they work for. Leave donations can be used to backfill sick leave and annual leave deficits.

If you'd like TTS to send out an email notifying your colleagues about your request for donated leave, [fill out this form](https://forms.gle/BmVKz5ByfW6XyYZ89). It's editable, so when you return to work you can fill in an end date.

In addition to the paid leave described above, employees can take leave without pay (under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA)) for up to 12 weeks per calendar year. Once you've been an employee of the federal government for at least 12 months, you're eligible to take FMLA, provided your supervisor approves it. You can take this leave within one year of the birth of your child. You do not need to take it all at once. Employees are eligible to take intermittent leave within the first year of their child’s birth. For instance, you could take unpaid leave on Tuesdays and Thursdays for several weeks in a row.

## Donating leave

Under the [Voluntary Leave Transfer Program](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/leave-administration/fact-sheets/voluntary-leave-transfer-program/) (VLTP), a covered employee may donate annual leave directly to another employee who has a personal or family medical emergency and who has exhausted their available paid leave. If you wish to donate annual leave, you will need to use MAX.gov to access the [VLTP](https://vltp.gsa.gov/) system following the steps below:

If your gsa.gov email address is not registered with MAX.gov, you will need to register at the OMB MAX.gov homepage:

- Select the "Register Now" button at the top right of that homepage and follow [these instructions](https://corporateapps.gsa.gov/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/VLTP_AccessLogin_2019.pdf) to register your PIV card and enable login (or use the email option if you don't yet have a PIV card reader)
- Go to [https://vltp.gsa.gov/](https://vltp.gsa.gov/) and follow the instructions below for registered users

If you are a registered MAX.gov user:

- Go to [https://vltp.gsa.gov/](https://vltp.gsa.gov/) and log in using your PIV card or GSA email with 2-factor authentication
- You will be taken to the GSA Payroll System VLTP page
- Click the button on the bottom to “Donate Annual Leave Hours To A Shared Leave Recipient”
- Follow the system prompts to donate leave (select "General Services Administration" as the agency and "0 - Central Office" as the region)

If you have any questions, please email our [Leave Policies contact](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15glvq9UakKUN8XTRTa6gRkhBHm2whhQyAGmf8ibTtBs/edit) in the Office of Human Resources Management. Also, don’t hesitate to ask in #parental-leave in Slack.

If the system gives you an error, try submitting through the [Citrix VDI]({{site.baseurl}}/tools/virtual-desktop/#logging-into-the-citrix-vdi) using Internet Explorer.

If the system is down, you can submit donation requests directly to Lakita Rivero (lakita.rivero@gsa.gov).

## Advanced leave

### Advanced annual leave

An employee may only take advanced annual leave in the amount they will earn back by the end of the current [leave year](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/leave-administration/fact-sheets/leave-year-beginning-and-ending-dates/), and the advanced leave may not exceed 80 hours.

Please note: You may receive an exception in HRLinks that "temporary appointment employees cannot be advanced annual leave." Policy allows the approval of advance leave for employees on limited appointments, but the amount of advance leave approved must not exceed the NTE or end of the leave year. The system will always give you an exception message when your leave balance is in the negative. When your supervisor goes into the system to approve your time, it is their responsibility to make a remark in the comment box noting their approval of advance leave.

![Screenshot reflecting negative leave balance exception]({{site.baseurl}}/images/leave/Advanced Leave timesheet exception.png)

You can find Leave Year beginning and end dates in this Office of Personnel Management (OPM) [fact sheet](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/leave-administration/fact-sheets/leave-year-beginning-and-ending-dates/).

### Advanced sick leave

In cases of serious disability or ailment, and when the exigencies of the situation so require, an employee may take advanced sick leave in an amount not to exceed 30 work days (240 hours). This advance may be granted whether or not the employee has any annual leave to their credit except where an application for disability retirement has been submitted to the Office of Personnel Management.

**For employees** **serving under a limited appointment (term appointments) or one which will be terminated on a specified date, they may be advanced sick leave up to the total amount of sick leave which would otherwise be earned during the term of that appointment.**

## Administrative leave

There are several other types of short-term leave available for reasons such as voting or blood donation. A more complete list of administrative leave reasons can be found [on Insite](https://insite.gsa.gov/topics/hr-pay-and-leave/pay-and-leave/leave/types-of-paid-leave#Other%20Types)

## Religious observance

Adjusting work schedules for religious observances is handled differently than leave. If you need to miss regular work hours for religious observance, you should notify your supervisor in writing in advance of the time you'll need to miss, along with the schedule of the time you will work outside of normal hours to compensate. For details, please see the relevant [OPM policy](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/work-schedules/fact-sheets/adjustment-of-work-schedules-for-religious-observances/).

## Time tracking

Billable TTS employees taking planned leave should follow guidance to [Tock when on leave]({{ site.baseurl }}/tools/tock/#tocking-for-out-of-office-time). For unplanned leave such as sudden illness or family emergency, do what you can to contact your supervisor, and they can help manage the rest on your behalf.

[HR Links](https://corporateapps.gsa.gov/hr-links/) is GSA's out of office request system and is separate from [Tock]({{ site.baseurl }}/tock), which is TTS' own timekeeping system. If you're taking time off, you'll need to make sure you're accounted for in both systems.

For more information on leave, see the [Benefits class]({{site.baseurl}}/getting-started/classes/benefits/) and the [GSA Tools and Equipment class]({{site.baseurl}}/getting-started/classes/gsa-internal-tools/).

## Transferring leave from another federal agency

Annual Leave and Sick Balances can take up to 3 pay periods to transfer to GSA depending on the speed of your previous payroll provider. If you have your final Earnings and Leave Statement available from your previous agency, you can send a copy to [kc-payroll.finance@gsa.gov](mailto:kc-payroll.finance@gsa.gov) to expedite the process.
