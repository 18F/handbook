## Common goals of an IDP

* Learn new skills and competencies to improve current job performance
* Maximize current performance in support of organizational requirements
* Assist employees in reaching career development goals.
* Increase interest, challenge, and satisfaction in current position
* Obtain knowledge, skills, and abilities necessary for a change in grade, series, or fields

## IDPs and conference, event, and training requests

An SF-182 is required for most conference, event, and training requests that have registration and/or travel costs. The SF-182 will need to be linked to an IDP that is updated with the conference, event, or training that you're attending and approved by your supervisor.  For more information on the SF-182 process, head over to the [Conferences, events, and training handbook page]({{site.baseurl}}/conferences-events-training/#additional-steps-that-you-may-need-to-take).
