There are many development and training opportunities within GSA that are available to TTS employees.

Supervisors are responsible for guiding their employees to developmental opportunities while individuals are responsible for taking the initiative to support their own development. There are resources [for supervisors](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HB9Gg2J_zra8SfJsxZ3cxyXvyaRfLhE8jw0q234KyXc/edit?usp=sharing) and [for employees](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jVolEwO-Kt0SPOJ5DJSzmhIzMPMUjeL35BTeMgdwj7A/edit?usp=sharing) that provide tips for how to recognize and seek ongoing growth opportunities.

In the Office of Human Resources Management (OHRM), GSA's Talent Development Division offers a number of different training, developmental, and coaching options. Here are training benefits available to all GSA employees.

## Free training and development opportunities

### Online University (OLU) trainings

The [Online University (OLU)](https://gsaolu.gsa.gov/) isn't just for mandatory trainings. It also offers over 2,000 personal development courses including: project management, coaching skills, finance, giving feedback, professional effectiveness and makes available a large selection of online books covering a wide range of subjects.

TTS also maintains a [curated list of free courses on OLU](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_IofrlGEDxOt54XWSrw9S0RlJOrlVcZjOJlcqxzMOOI/edit?usp=sharing) that are open to all TTS employees on a first-come, first-served basis. This list is updated weekly, and most of these trainings are virtual to make it accessible to everyone.
