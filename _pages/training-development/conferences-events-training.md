TTS encourages all staff to attend conferences, speak at events, and focus on professional development and training opportunities. Check out the [TTS Training Database](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vB1xbe02jCpKYn6BGSyCH2FziIRNkXXi29yAFT5N9Dg/edit#gid=1891423646) to see what conferences and trainings your colleagues have attended.

Any media requests (like news or podcast interviews) are a separate process — please forward the email or reach out to [press@gsa.gov](mailto:press@gsa.gov).

## Getting approval for a conference, event, or training

1. Submit [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeQHPIOtNwzEA7IxrJ4JDHeEUrWNUsiEkbnp8lK26jX04PYBg/viewform?usp=sf_link) to initiate the request process.  ***Here is [guidance on writing an event justification](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13BCETwANCx9JRPgFbRibqRGthIvf4XQ-WTYD0P30PWg/edit?usp=sharing).***  Upon completing it, you and your supervisor will get an automated email, which confirms the details you entered and provides all of the actions that you will need to complete for the request.  Your supervisor may want to discuss the request with you before proceeding with further approvals.

1. Once you've connected with your supervisor, continue following all steps outlined by the email that you received.  If you have any issues or questions about your request, please respond to the Events Team (tts-events@gsa.gov) on the automated email thread.  An Events Team member will follow up with you within 2 business days.

1. You will receive an automated email when your request has been fully approved and paid for or if additional information is needed to complete your registration. You can [track the status of your request here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HqsdJ-pHZcg4n8vWwfOo8-sxAFfP1LtWxRVBWEbZnMA/edit#gid=0) with the request number in the subject line of the automated email.

*Important note about conference travel:* If you are traveling to a conference on behalf of a partner who is paying for the travel and the registration and you will be billing the partner for your time, an IDP and SF-182 approval is not needed. Also an SF-182 isn't needed if the conference is NOT deemed a training activity.

### Attending a virtual event

If the event that you're attending is being hosted virtually, please review the [TTS Virtual Events guidance](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YrDs9PA8HkfLkhSfOfyJnLjAYcTkV6_vHlU7HBoyi0k/edit#heading=h.d6kk6wkyrvzf) for important considerations and tips.

***NOTE: If you are attending a free virtual event and will NOT be speaking, you do not need to fill out the Event Request Google Form above.  Please just discuss in advance with your Supervisor if you will be attending during work hours.***

## Approval timelines

The review and approval process times vary by the type of request and the layers of approval required.  It is best to submit your [training request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeQHPIOtNwzEA7IxrJ4JDHeEUrWNUsiEkbnp8lK26jX04PYBg/viewform?usp=sf_link) as early as possible.

## Additional steps that you may need to take

The automated email that you will receive outlines the step(s) below that you will need to complete for your request.

### Creating an SF-182 (required for most conference, event, and training requests that have registration and/or travel costs)

1. [Create a Salesforce SF-182 form](https://gsa--c.na21.visual.force.com/apex/IDP_HomePage)

- Start this process by adding this event to your [Individual Development Plan (IDP)](https://gsa--c.na21.visual.force.com/apex/IDP_HomePage?sfdc.tabName=01rt0000000L2d8) in Salesforce and have your supervisor approve.
  - For IDP information and instructions on how to create one, head to the [IDP handbook page]({{site.baseurl}}/idp/)
- After your IDP is approved by your supervisor, you can then generate a Standard Form 182 (SF-182) in Salesforce.
- Once you have generated an SF-182, you will select approvers based on the email instructions that you've sent.  
    - Most trainings require **supervisor**, then **Keith Wilson** as Approver 1, then your **business unit lead** as Approver 2, and then your TTS Assistant Commissioner, **Ashley Mahan** or **Harry Lee**, as Approver 3.
    - Most events require **supervisor**, then **Keith Wilson** as Approver 1.
- You will add **Djemila McCray** as your purchase card holder, then hit the 'submit for approval' button which is located at the bottom of the screen of the SF-182 form.

The SF-182 must be fully approved before any final actions such as paying for registration or approval of travel in Concur can be taken. Once your SF-182 has been fully approved, download a PDF copy and send it to [tts-events@gsa.gov](mailto:tts-events@gsa.gov). Ensure your SF-182 is completed and sent over at least two business days before your registration would need to be completed to give the purchasing team sufficient time to process.

### Booking travel

You can start making [Travel Arrangements in Concur]({{site.baseurl}}/travel-guide-1-book-travel/) (if needed) at any point in the process, even before you've submitted the [Events request form]( https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeQHPIOtNwzEA7IxrJ4JDHeEUrWNUsiEkbnp8lK26jX04PYBg/viewform?usp=sf_link) if you would like to get an estimate of travel costs.  Most travel reservations will automatically cancel if not approved.

You are responsible for cancelling all reservations (e.g. flight, hotel, rental car) if your event is not approved.  Always **check the cancellation policy before booking** because you may be responsible for paying the cancellation fee(s).  You can ask questions in [#travel](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/messages/travel/) or during [travel office hours](https://sites.google.com/a/gsa.gov/tts-office-hours/).

## Remote working guidance

When working from somewhere that isn't your usual duty location, consider [these tips]({{site.baseurl}}/working-while-traveling) to help coworkers and partners plan around your trip.

## After the event

Add your notes about the conference or training to the [TTS Training Database](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vB1xbe02jCpKYn6BGSyCH2FziIRNkXXi29yAFT5N9Dg/edit#gid=1891423646) for your colleagues to read and learn from!

## Buying books

You can also use your training budget to buy books for self-guided study. Approval for books follows the same process as approvals for trainings. You'll need to fill out the same forms but using the names of the books you want to buy.
