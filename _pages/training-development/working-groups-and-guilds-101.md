navtitle: Working groups and guilds

TTS has a collection of communities to help develop best practices, provide training, explore new ideas,and help solve thorny issues.

These volunteer groups decide how and where to focus their efforts and conversations, in coordination with TTS leadership. Anyone may participate in any of these groups.

## Working groups
A working group is a group of people working together to investigate a particular problem and achieve specified goals. They are usually self-organized, and are expected to short-lived and spin up or down depending on organizational needs. The best possible outcome for a working group is to no longer be needed, because it has solved the problem it was formed to solve.

Working groups are usually started by a handful group of people who recognize a problem, then recruit like-minded souls willing to help find a solution. Usually, but not always, the problem is localized to just one part of TTS. Once solved, the working group winds down.

Because working groups are typically trying to solve a problem *right now* starting a working group is relatively simple: Just be able to articulate the problem you want to solve, then have a chat with your org leadership. Typically, that will be your Chief of Staff, Chief of Practices or Deputy Director, depending on which part of TTS you're in. They'll want to talk to you about whether it's a problem the organization is willing to commit resources to solving right now, and may connect you with other people already working on similar issues.

Most working groups will create a Slack channel to coordinate efforts. These channels should have a `wg-` prefix. Feel free to jump into any of these channels you see to participate or ask questions.

The [TTS Working Groups & Guilds Calendar](https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=gsa.gov_o1aqcv28k1f0nmca5bkch8los4%40group.calendar.google.com) can help you find working group meeting times.



## Guilds
Guilds are long-running groups sponsored by the TTS Chief of Staff, and as such are expected to coordinate practices and solve problems across TTS. Because they are cross-TTS structures, their leadership should come from more than one part of TTS and they should provide clear value to a broad cross-section of TTS through training and promotion of best practices in their subject area.

18F provides non-billable hours to guild leads to help them meet those expectations.

Guild Slack channels have a `g-` before the name. Just as with working groups, you do not need permission to participate. Just jump right in. 

The open Slack channel for guild leaders & other practice leaders who wish to join is `#guild-practice-leads`

Guild meeting times can also be found on the [TTS Working Groups & Guilds Calendar](https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=gsa.gov_o1aqcv28k1f0nmca5bkch8los4%40group.calendar.google.com).

Because guilds are intended to work across TTS, they are coordinated by a group made up of leadership from across TTS. If you hope to create a new Guild, you'll needwhich means creating a new Guild requires taking it to that group for approval. If you'd like to create a new guild, have a talk with your Chief of Staff, Chief of Practices or Deputy Director (again, depending on which part of TTS you're in) and they'll take it to the group for approval. At a minimum, they'll want to know:

* How will this guild be beneficial to all of TTS? How does it provide organizational value?
* Who do you expect to start and lead the guild, and what parts of TTS are they coming from?
* What does the guild intend to do? What are the expected deliverables?
* If there are groups working on similar problems, how does the proposed guild differ?

### Guild leadership

Guilds should be led people from different parts of TTS. They should expect to spend a few hours per week on guild leadership, meetings, and preparation. Individual guilds can set their own leadership terms, with the most common being one year. 

Guild leadership is recognized by a staff memberâ€™s supervisor as a responsibility and they should be reviewed on their performance. However, it is an informal role. There are no administrative supervisory duties attached and there is no GS-level or previous leadership requirement.

Typically guilds follow a lightweight leadership selection process:

1. The guild asks for nominations via email and Slack posting. Guilds can choose to allow self-nomination only, or accept nominations by other people with confirmation of interest by the nominee. Nominees should have the verbal approval of their supervisor. Written nominations totalling no more than 400 words are recommended; guilds choose nomination questions.
1. A panel of one-three people made up of guild leadership, other guild members and/or leadership from other guilds conduct brief (no more than 30 minute) interviews of candidates and makes a selection.
1. A current guild leader announces the new leader, who takes up the position immediately.

## Communities of Practice
A Community of Practice (CoP) provides for government-wide knowledge-sharing. They attract members from across government agencies, and provide a good opportunity for Guilds to connect with others in government and influence best practices beyond TTS.

Digital.gov [hosts the Communities of Practice](http://digital.gov/communities/), including the following:
