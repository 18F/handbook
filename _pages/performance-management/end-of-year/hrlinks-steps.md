## Creating a new performance plan

In most cases, supervisors should own the creation of performance plans for direct reports. This step applies to employees who require a new performance plan such as new employees and existing employees who have recently changed roles.

## Re-opening a performance plan

If modifications need to be made to an existing performance plan, a plan can be re-opened by the Supervisor and [resubmitted to the employee to acknowledge]({{site.baseurl}}/performance-management/end-of-year/hrlinks-steps/#submitting-a-performance-plan-for-employee-approval).

**_NOTE: 120 days must pass from the date the employee acknowledges the updated plan before they can be rated against it._**

## Nominating participant reviewer(s)

This process allows supervisors and employees to [solicit feedback](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1O3G3fa2ezbz_SUqBRT3OZRt0QPrLapl6) from other supervisors or colleagues regarding their Performance Plan. HR Links allows both employees and supervisors to nominate and track participant reviews; however, only supervisors can officially submit a nomination. If an employee nominates another employee for feedback on their performance, the nomination is submitted to the [supervisor for approval](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1V9gF5BB6z78mm9gr8sHhdP70jzKa9j7t5DlSChNG9-c/edit?usp=sharing). **You must inform your Supervisor that you have submitted the nomination(s) for approval because HR Links does NOT notify them of this action.**

Once nominated, participant reviewers receive a notification alerting them of the evaluation request. The employee's supervisor is required to review and approve all feedback from participant reviews.

_NOTE: A participant reviewer will need to [“Accept” or “Decline”](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13VNcGwXrT6Esse2mfpGjJ-DZFbX8f_iqAaJlhpwuSCk/edit?usp=sharing) to provide feedback, if nominated, and will only be able to see the employee appraisal information that they provided._

## Submitting a participant review

Submitting a participant review in HR Links is the same process for all nominated colleagues regardless of their reporting relationship to the employee. TTS Supervisors will have to review and approve all participant reviews for their direct reports in HR Links as part of the final employee evaluation submittal process.

## Closing out an interim performance plan (the plan will not factor into the end of year performance award)

If a TTS employees has two performance plans of record, both plans need to be closed out; however, only the most recent plan will factor into the end of year performance award if the other plan is closed out properly. Supervisors should discuss both plans with their direct reports and provide ratings that are as accurate as possible because both plans will still be visible in the employee's record. The step-by-step instructions below show how to rate and submit the "old" plan properly.

- Step-by-step instructions:
  - No action required by employee
  - Supervisor will need to [follow these instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10WP9J0MeH-PovXlZqXvkAH_ePQuHaPnXZnou2FEq0_I/edit)

## Selecting Time Off Award in lieu of cash performance award

Information will be updated pending guidance from GSA.
