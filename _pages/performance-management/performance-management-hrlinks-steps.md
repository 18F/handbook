## HR Links performance management steps

### Creating a new performance plan
In most cases, supervisors should own the creation of performance plans for direct reports.  This step applies to employees who require a new performance plan such as new employees and existing employees who have recently changed roles.

### Nominating participant reviewer(s)

This process allows supervisors and employees to [solicit feedback](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1O3G3fa2ezbz_SUqBRT3OZRt0QPrLapl6) from other supervisors or colleagues regarding their Performance Plan. HR Links allows both employees and supervisors to nominate and track participant reviews; however, only supervisors can officially submit a nomination.  If an employee nominates another employee for feedback on their performance, the nomination is submitted to the supervisor for approval.

Once nominated, participant reviewers receive a notification alerting them of the evaluation request. The employee's supervisor is required to review and approve all feedback from participant reviews. *NOTE: A participant reviewer will only be able to see the employee appraisal information that they provided.*

### Submitting a participant review
Submitting a participant review in HR Links is the same process for all nominated colleagues regardless of their reporting relationship to the employee.  TTS Supervisors will have to review and approve all participant reviews for their direct reports in HR Links as part of the final employee evaluation submittal process.

* Step-by-step instructions:

### Establishing a performance plan for the new fiscal year
Employees have the option to update duty specific measures and/or weights -with supervisor approval- when establishing their FY20 performance plans in HR Links:

* Employee needs to review their FY19 performance plan that's been in place 120+ days and decide if/how they want to update measures and category weights
* During 1:1 performance review session (in addition to finalizing the FY19 performance review):
  * Supervisor clones employee's FY19 plan to create a template for the FY20 plan
    * ***NOTE: FY19 Supervisors should clone all of their direct reports' performance plans to create, sign, and submit the FY20 plan even if an empoloyee will not be reporting into them in FY20 (i.e. post TTS reorg). If updates need to be made to the FY20 performance plan, the FY20 Supervisor will need to [re-open the FY20 performance plan in HR Links]({{site.baseurl}}/performance-management-hrlinks-steps/#re-opening-a-performance-plan) (Supervisors will be notified via email when an employee has been reassigned to them). The FY20 supervisor should connect with new direct report(s) to discuss any potential changes to their FY20 performance plan.***
  * Employee discusses FY20 performance plan updates with their supervisor
  * Employee works with their Supervisor to make updates to the FY20 performance plan in HR Links
  * Supervisor ["signs and submits"]({{site.baseurl}}/performance-management-hrlinks-steps/#submitting-a-performance-plan-for-employee-approval) the FY20 performance plan in HR Links
* Employee should [“acknowledge”]({{site.baseurl}}/performance-management-hrlinks-steps/#acknowledging-a-performance-plan) their FY20 performance plan by November 14

*Note: FY20 performance plans may be further modified in the first few months of the new fiscal year to account for any updates to TTS and/or Business Unit level specific measure that leadership determines necessary. If this takes place, performance plans will need to be updated and re-established so that employees can be rated against those updated performance plans.*

### Confirming that performance plans have been established

It is critical that all FY19 performance plan evaluations are acknowledged by employees before November 14 and all FY20 performance plans are acknowledged by employees before November 29. The status of employee performance management can be checked in the *Team Performance Supervisor dashboard*:

* Step-by-step instructions:
  * No action required by employee

### Selecting Time Off Award in lieu of cash performance award

For the FY19 performance review cycle, employees who would like a time off award ***in lieu of cash*** must select their award type preference in HR Links no later than November 14, 2019. If time-off is not indicated in HR Links, then the default will be a cash award.  If you've selected a time off award in previous performance review cycles, this may still be active in HR Links; make sure to delete that selection if you would like to receive the cash individual performance reward instead.

***Note: Award time off must be used within one year of issuance and does not get paid out (like annual leave) if you leave GSA.***
