### Nominating participant reviewer(s)

This process allows supervisors and employees to [solicit feedback](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1O3G3fa2ezbz_SUqBRT3OZRt0QPrLapl6) from other supervisors or colleagues regarding their Performance Plan. HR Links allows both employees and supervisors to nominate and track participant reviews; however, only supervisors can officially submit a nomination.  If an employee nominates another employee for feedback on their performance, the nomination is submitted to the supervisor for approval.

Once nominated, participant reviewers receive a notification alerting them of the evaluation request. The employee's supervisor is required to review and approve all feedback from participant reviews. *NOTE: A participant reviewer will only be able to see the employee appraisal information that they provided.*

### Submitting a participant review
Submitting a participant review in HR Links is the same process for all nominated colleagues regardless of their reporting relationship to the employee.  TTS Supervisors will have to review and approve all participant reviews for their direct reports in HR Links as part of the final employee evaluation submittal process.
