#### Gather supporting documentation

Supporting documentation that aligns with your Performance Management Plan is ***optional*** for the performance review process. Examples of supporting documentation include emails, written performance counseling, customer feedback, survey results, supervisory notes, database/spreadsheets, and/or work samples within the current rating cycle.

This information can be shared with your Supervisor during your mid-year and end-of-year 1:1 performance review conversation.

#### TTS performance rating tool
Use of this tool is optional but can be helpful in determining what your end-of-year rating may be once the performance review is complete. This tool can be used as a reference during your 1:1 performance review conversation with your supervisor. Note that your supervisor will make final rating determinations on all specific measures associated with your performance plan.

  1. Make a copy of the tool
  1. Personalize the template corresponding to your performance plan structure and weight distribution
  1. Assign a performance rating to your specific measures within each of the five critical elements
