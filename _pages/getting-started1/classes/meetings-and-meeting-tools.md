Here are some of the tools TTS uses to facilitate meetings:

- For scheduling, use [Google Calendar]({{site.baseurl}}/google-calendar/)
- For notes, use [Google Docs]({{site.baseurl}}/google-drive/)
- See also: [collaboration tools]({{site.baseurl}}/collaboration-tools/)

## Videoconferencing

Video conferencing tools enable staff all over the country to video chat and screenshare in remote meetings. We’ve found that video calls help teams stay connected and are easier to manage than conference calls for large groups.

**See [InSite](https://insite.gsa.gov/employee-resources/information-technology/do-it-yourself-self-help/virtual-and-online-meetings) for options.** Additional option not listed there:

| Service                                                                             | Capacity                                                                         | Dial-in option? |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| [Slack calls](https://slack.com/help/articles/115003498363-Slack-Calls--the-basics) | [15](https://slack.com/help/articles/216771908-Make-calls-in-Slack#start-a-call) | N               |

The ones with dial-in options can be used without video (say, if video is blocked by the partner agency), as well. Recordings of meetings are [records]({{site.baseurl}}/records-management/).

### Common barriers to using these tools with partners

- **IF** partners don’t have access to video/cameras, **THEN** use audio only with screen-sharing.
- **IF** blocked by firewall/security issues, **THEN** see if they have access to a different tool. See [using partners’ tools]({{site.baseurl}}/general-information-and-resources/collaboration-tools/#using-partners-tools).

### Connectivity issues

If you are having connectivity issues when videoconferencing, try:

1. Adjusting video quality settings

   - [Meet](https://support.google.com/a/users/answer/9302964#adjust-video-quality)
   - [Zoom](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362623-Changing-settings-in-the-desktop-client-or-mobile-app)

2. Turning off video
3. Dialing in
4. Switching to a different tool

## Compliance with GSA policies

Our agency maintains a formal [meeting, conference, and event policy](<https://www.gsa.gov/portal/mediaId/205471/fileName/OAS_57851_Conference_and_Event_Management_(Signed_on_January_28__2015).action>). The most applicable part of this policy for TTS is the approval requirement for internal meetings that _require the travel of more than six employees or will cost more than $10,000._ For these meetings, approval of both the Commissioner of the Technology Transformation Service and the Deputy Administrator of GSA via the [Salesforce Event Tracker](https://gsa.my.salesforce.com/a1b/o) system. For further information and help getting your request submitted, go to the [\#training-conferences](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/messages/training-conferences) Slack channel.
