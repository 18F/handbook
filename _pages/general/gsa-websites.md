# What we're trying to accomplish

The EDX team is seeking to support the evolution of all GSA websites toward a set of identified standards.
The standards are described [here:]({{site.baseurl}}/TBD-TBD-TBD-another-page-about-what-we-track-for-websites).

If we do this, we will be in compliance with the letter and the spirit of guidance
like 21st Century IDEA, we will provide more consistent experiences, less duplicative experiences,
save costs, and improve content and data management.
