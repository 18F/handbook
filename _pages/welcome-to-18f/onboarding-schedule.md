title: Onboarding schedule
---

_This series of onboarding classes is designed to explain how we work and introduce you to folks from across the organization. All trainings take place in [#18f-classes](https://18f.slack.com/messages/18f-classes/)._

Most of these trainings are optional (with the exception of the [Infrastructure class](/classes/#infrastructure-team), which is required since it has critical legal, regulatory, and policy implications for your work). For the optional ones, if you have a conflicting team meeting or another commitment, prioritize that first! You can easily read a class chat log later.

## About the schedule

This is a typical onboarding schedule, but the timing may shift based on when you’re hired and federal holidays, etc. Check out the [18F Classes Schedule](https://www.google.com/calendar/b/1/embed?src=gsa.gov_vpfql4425bt1kj5fatahokgg94@group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America/New_York) in Google Calendar for exact times. (If you can’t find it, copy and paste [this address](gsa.gov_vpfql4425bt1kj5fatahokgg94@group.calendar.google.com) into the “Add a coworker’s calendar” field under “Other calendars”.)
