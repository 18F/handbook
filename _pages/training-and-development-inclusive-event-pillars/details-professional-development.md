A detail is a temporary assignment from one position within the federal government to another, with the expectation that you will return to your official position upon completion.

A detail can be a great way to develop and grow your skills while expanding your professional network. It can also be a way to learn more about a different area of government without permanently switching jobs. Generally, details are from 30 - 120 days, though some may be extended on a case-by-case basis.

Detail opportunities can be found through formal channels or can be crafted by leveraging professional relationships. This [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cF8SdNhZSBcZXQy566-ZLO5PWK_nVUYmgUGLGzlfq9k/edit#gid=0) includes the names of employees across TTS who have gone on detail.

Within GSA, the [GSA Opportunity Network](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tvUDjm9bV42kHF7M7C7ZqA1PnI5qICnI4WBqZOMvDbU/edit) is where details within various parts of the agency are posted; outside of GSA, [Open Opportunities](https://openopps.usajobs.gov/) lists small tasks, projects and details across the federal government.

Details can also be formed through personal interest and networking. The TTS #alumni Slack channel is an available resource: many alumni have gone on to other federal agencies.

There is no one way to craft a detail opportunity. However, it may be helpful to think through the following:

- In what areas do you want to get more on-the-job training?
- In what agencies or parts of government can you receive that training?
- How can your and TTS’s networks be leveraged to connect with individuals at that organization?
- Does the receiving organization have a business need? What value will you bring to their organization?
- How would a detail with the organization align to your professional growth plan?
- How would it benefit TTS/GSA?
- Would the detail be reimbursable (the other agency pays your salary) or non-reimbursable?
- Who could backfill your duties while you’re on detail?

## Process

There is paperwork and approvals needed in order to go on detail. There are Handbook pages for the 3 most common scenarios:

- [Details within TTS]({{site.baseurl}}/hiring-staying-or-changing-jobs/assignee-detail/#internal-posting-process)
- [Details within GSA]({{site.baseurl}}/gsa-details/)
- [Details to/from another agency]({{site.baseurl}}/hiring-staying-or-changing-jobs/external-details/#going-on-an-external-detail)

GSA also has a policy on [Details to the Legislative Branch](https://www.gsa.gov/cdnstatic/HRM_9334.2_Detail_of_Employees_%28Posted_Version_-_Signed_on_-_7-8-2016%29_%23CC033627_%28Revised_3-7-2017%29.pdf).
