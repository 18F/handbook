TTS encourages all staff to attend conferences, speak at events and focus on professional development and training opportunities.

## Getting approval for a conference, event, or training

1. Meet with your supervisor to discuss the conference, speaking opportunity, event, and/or training.

1. Submit [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeQHPIOtNwzEA7IxrJ4JDHeEUrWNUsiEkbnp8lK26jX04PYBg/viewform) to initiate the request process.  

1. Upon completing it, you and your supervisor will get an automated email, which confirms the details you entered and gives you some personalized next steps.  

1. Within two business days, a training team member will reach out to you directly and be your point of contact through the entire process, including creating your Salesforce Event Tracker request.  Please do not input an Event Tracker request until the training team has reached out to you.

1. Watch your email and wait for Event Tracker approval. You can [track the status of your request here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HqsdJ-pHZcg4n8vWwfOo8-sxAFfP1LtWxRVBWEbZnMA/edit#gid=0).

###Booking travel

While you wait for your Salesforce request to get approved, you can make [Travel Arrangements in Concur](https://handbook.18f.gov/travel-guide-1-book-travel/) (if needed).  Most travel reservations will automatically cancel if not approved.  If you book outside of Concur for the conference hotel, you are responsible for cancelling any reservation if your event is not approved. You are responsible for any cancellation fees if you fail to follow the conference hotel cancellation policy.  You can ask questions in [#travel](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/messages/travel/) or during [travel office hours](https://sites.google.com/a/gsa.gov/tts-office-hours/).

### Creating an SF-182

1. [Create a Salesforce SF-182 form](https://gsa--c.na21.visual.force.com/apex/IDP_HomePage)

   * Select your current supervisor
   * Select Michael Proul as the first approver
   * Select Dominic Sale as the second approver, if the training is below $2500 (including travel),
   * Select FAS HSSO Tricia Sieveke, if the training is more than $2500 (including travel)
   * Choose Ethan Heppner or Leah Gitter as the Purchase Card Holder

1. Watch your email and wait for Event Tracker approvals and SF182 approvals. If you have questions about the status ask in slack #training-conferences or send a slack DM to your training POC.

1. Send your SF-182 approval to your training team POC.

## Approval Timelines
The review and approval process times vary by the type of request and the layers of approval required.  It is best to submit your [training request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeQHPIOtNwzEA7IxrJ4JDHeEUrWNUsiEkbnp8lK26jX04PYBg/viewform) as early as possible. The training team works diligently to review and process requests within one business days of submission. Your request  will go more smoothly if all required information is included in the training request.  You can [track the status of your request here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HqsdJ-pHZcg4n8vWwfOo8-sxAFfP1LtWxRVBWEbZnMA/edit#gid=0)
