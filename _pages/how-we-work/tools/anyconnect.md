AnyConnect is a VPN client that we use to connect to GSA's intranet.

## Setup

### VPN Client
Your machine may already have AnyConnect installed. If it is, it will be under Cisco>AnyConnect in your Applications.

If it is not installed, here is how you can get access:

1. Request the AnyConnect VPN Client via [ServiceNow](https://gsa.service-now.com/sp?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=1bfdfdca78d3a400ce3ddff91a64940b&sysparm_category=b628125b7cec0100a6e757fe35f45fb8). Someone from GSA IT will reach out to you within the day.
2. Follow their directions to install AnyConnect.

Your installation screen should look like this:

* [Install the phone app](https://preview-insite.gsa.gov/employee-resources/information-technology/do-it-yourself-self-help/telework-technology/secureauth/install-secureauth-otp-on-ios-apple) that will generate one-time passwords that you will need to connect to the VPN.

## Usage
