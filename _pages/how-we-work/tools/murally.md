[Mural](https://mural.co/) is a collaborative whiteboard and sticky note tool.

## Setup

Because Mural is a web application, there’s no installation necessary. You will need to set up an account, however. If you don’t already have a Mural account, ask in Slack for the invitation link, and from there, create an account with your GSA email address. In order to have access to all 18F public rooms and create your own rooms, you need an admin to give you those permissions. Post a link the the #admins-mural channel to get access.

## Usage

- Mural consists of “rooms” (for example, FEC) and “murals” (for example, User Research). There’s only one “team:” 18F.
- Rooms can be public or private to the rest of the team. If rooms within the 18F group are set to public, anyone at 18F can view them. If they’re private, only people specifically invited to them can see them.
- People outside of 18F or GSA can be added as guests to the 18F workspace. Guests have fewer permissions than members. They cannot create rooms, publish templates, or see open rooms. Guests do not cost any money to add, so follow the instructions in the next bullet to add your partners! 
- In order to add and offboard guests, please ask in the #admins-mural Slack channel. While you can do it yourself, it is easier for the Mural workspace administrator to keep track of guests and members for administrative purposes if you ask in #admins-mural. The administrator is very responsive and will answer your request within 48 hours. The administrator will add the partner as a guest and the guest will get an invitation inviting them to join the 18F workspace. 
- You can also share a Mural link with your partners and they can join as an anonymous user without having a Mural account of their own. They cannot access the rest of the 18F workspace, but you can invite them to view and edit your Mural.
- The benefit of adding your partner as a guest and not an anonymous user is that you will be able to see what contributions they are making to a Mural. They will be called by name in the Mural, whereas anonymous users will be shown as an animal, not their name.
- If you have any questions, please ask in #admins-mural.
