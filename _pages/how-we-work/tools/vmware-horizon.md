VMware Horizon is a Windows virtual desktop client that can be used to connect to GSAâ€™s intranet, or test something in Internet Explorer.

## Setup

New employees should have a GSA VMware myView/Horizon account, but if not:

1. Go to [servicedesk.gsa.gov](http://servicedesk.gsa.gov/).
1. Sign in with your ENT username and password.
1. Click **Order Something**.
1. Click **Horizon(VDI)**.
1. Complete the required fields.
1. Click **Add to Cart**.
1. Click **Checkout**.

## Logging into VMWare Horizon

1. Click on the VMware Horizon icon (on your desktop)
2. Enter `horizon.gsa.gov` for server
3. Use ENT info for initial VMware Horizon login-in screen
4. Go to [otp.gsa.gov](http://otp.gsa.gov) and enter your ENT info to get the Tokencode
   - You can also obtain a Tokencode by installing SecureAuth OTP on your
     phone, as described in the [Get a one-time password?]({{site.baseurl}}/distributed/#get-a-one-time-password)
     handbook section
5. Enter the Tokencode back into VMware Horizon login-in screen

## Usage

See [the InSite page](https://insite.gsa.gov/portal/category/536270). Note that you may need to follow the "Personal Mac" instructions.

## Software

Horizon is the easiest way to use software that's available for Windows but not Mac. If the software you need isn't already pre-installed, you can request installation by [opening a Software request with the GSA IT Service Desk](https://gsa.service-now.com/sp/?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=1bfdfdca78d3a400ce3ddff91a64940b). Make sure to note that you are requesting installation in VDI, not your laptop.

## Tips

- To move files between your laptop and your Horizon desktop, use Google Drive. You can use Chrome in the Horizon desktop to download and upload files.
