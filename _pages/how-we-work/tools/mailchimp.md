We use MailChimp and its [Mandrill](../mandrill/) add-on to send transactional emails.

* Slack: [#admins-mailchimp](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/messages/admins-mailchimp/)

## <a id="setup">Setup</a>

1. Create a [MailChimp](https://login.mailchimp.com/signup) account associated
   with your GSA email address.
2. File a new issue in the [18F/Infrastructure](https://github.com/18F/Infrastructure/issues/new)
   repository. Title it **Please add me to the MailChimp account**, include
   the GSA email address you used to sign up for MailChimp, and assign the
   issue to [@afeld](https://github.com/afeld).

Once you've been added to the shared account, you can log in to
[Mandrill](https://mandrillapp.com/)--an add-on for MailChimp that allows you
to send transactional emails.

For more information on using MailChimp and/or Mandrill, such as
details on SMTP configuration, please see the
[Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XdedSaLHpV-b9rbFfnckRRYmatGJm-8jG5qzwfnWVfc/edit).
