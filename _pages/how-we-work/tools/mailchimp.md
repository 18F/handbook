We use MailChimp and its [Mandrill](../mandrill/) add-on to send transactional emails.

## Communication

* Slack: [#admins-mailchimp](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/messages/admins-mailchimp/)

## Setup

1. Create a [MailChimp](https://login.mailchimp.com/signup) account associated
   with your GSA email address.
1. [File a new issue in the 18F/Infrastructure repository](https://github.com/18F/Infrastructure/issues/new?title=Please%20add%20me%20to%20the%20MailChimp%20account&assignee=erik-burgess), stating:
    * What you need the account for
    * The approximate volume of emails you expect to be sending/receiving
