We use Google Analytics to track traffic and search queries on TTS projects.

## Leadership

## Communication

* Slack: [#g-analytics](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/messages/g-analytics/)

* Repo: [analytics standards](https://github.com/18F/analytics-standards)

## Setup

Because Google Analytics is a web application, thereâ€™s no installation necessary. Request access in [#g-analytics](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/messages/g-analytics/). Access is granted within a day or so.
