## Errors and troubleshooting

You may experience errors while trying to use eSign. A common error message is *Your License Has Expired* even when licenses are not the issue. If you get a confusing error, check the following:

- Make sure your PDFs are not editable PDFs; if they are, use Preview to re-export them as PDFs and try uploading again.
- Make sure your VPN is still connected.
