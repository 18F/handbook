# Gmail

We use Gmail for email.

## Usage

You can access your email from <https://mail.google.com> or <https://mail.gsa.gov>.

## Rules

**Abide by [the 18F Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct).** If you see anyone violating our Code of Conduct, please contact [Noah Kunin](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/messages/noah/) or [Hillary Hartley](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/messages/hillary/).

## Tips

- **Enable clickable `mailto:` links in Chrome**:

  - Navigate to your inbox, https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox
  - Click on the interlocking diamonds icon on the right in your address bar
  - In the dialog, _Allow mail.google.com to open all email links_

  ![addressbar](/images/chrome_address_bar.png)

  - You can read more about Chrome's protocol handlers at [The Complete Guide to Google Chrome Handlers](http://www.ashout.com/complete-guide-to-google-chrome-handlers/)

- **If you go by a different name, create an alias.** You can create an alias to have a different email address, like if you go by something other than your legal name.

- **Create filters.** You can create filters to manage the influx of automatic emails you’ll be receiving (like Region X Communications). You can select "add a label" and automatically “archive" or put messages into different folders.

- **You can set your photo** for your Google profile in [Gmail settings](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/35529?hl=en).


# Google Analytics

We use Google Analytics to track traffic and search queries on 18F projects.

## Leadership

[Gray Brooks](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/team/gray)

## Communication

* Slack: [#g-analytics](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/messages/g-analytics/)

* Repo: [analytics standards](https://github.com/18F/analytics-standards)

## <a id="setup">Setup</a>

Because Google Analytics is a web application, there’s no installation necessary. Request access in [#g-analytics](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/messages/g-analytics/). Access is granted within a day or so.


# Google Calendar

Google Calendar is an online calendar that provides us with a single point of reference for scheduling time.

## Setup

Because Google Calendar is a web application, there's no installation necessary.

## Usage

The following calendars are used for internal communication:

* [18F Events](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=gsa.gov_3rapmucstu32ma18da84el20ug%40group.calendar.google.com): Team-wide events, start dates, standups, and so on.
* [18F Classes](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=gsa.gov_vpfql4425bt1kj5fatahokgg94%40group.calendar.google.com): New hire and skill-bases training sessions.
* 18F Interviews: New hire interviews.
* [18F Out of office](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=gsa.gov_bth7useo0eeiicjgos2di6ph8k%40group.calendar.google.com): Out-of-office and vacation notices.
* [18F Working Groups](https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=gsa.gov_o1aqcv28k1f0nmca5bkch8los4%40group.calendar.google.com): Meetings and other events pertaining to working groups and guilds.

You can add the above calendars to your Google calendar by clicking on the link to launch the HTML view and then clicking on `+Google Calendar` on the bottom right of the screen.

In addition to <em>officially</em> requesting time off in <a href="/gsa-tools-equipment-and-transit#aloha">ALOHA</a>, please also add an event on the Google calendar "18F Out of Office" and invite yourself, so we all know when you’re gone.

## Tips

- To add a video call to your calendar invite: create an event, click **Edit event**, and under **Video call** click **Add video call**. Google gives the call a default name, but you can click **Change name** to customize it. Then click **Save**. ([Demonstration.]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/google-calendar/2.gif))
- To automatically find a time when everyone is available: create an event, add everyone who needs to attend as a guest, and click **Suggested times**. ([Demonstration.]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/google-calendar/3.gif))
- People occasionally use [Doodle](http://www.doodle.com/) to send out meeting-time surveys. If you're flexible on when you want your meeting to start, it's a great idea to send out a Doodle and poll attendees on what times work for them.
- Remember to copy out of office (OOO) calendar items to your own calendar so that meeting planning tools pick them up.
- You can't share calendars with anyone outside GSA. You can share individual invites, just not whole calendars.

## Customize it

Google Calendar has some handy features hiding under its ⚙ button (at top right), both under **Settings** and **Labs**. If you have some time, look around. Here are a few examples.

### Specify your working hours

Specifying your working hours will mark you as busy during non-working hours. Your colleagues will get a warning if they try to schedule you outside those times.

1. In the Settings menu, click **Settings**.  ![Setting Menu]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/google-calendar/1.png)  
2. **Under General > Working hours**, select **Show a warning to other people when they invite me to an event outside my working hours**.
3. Specify the days and times you prefer to work.
4. Click **Save**.

### Hide morning and evening hours

To change the default calendar view so you only see your working hours:

1. In the Settings menu, click **Settings**.
2. Under **Labs > Hide morning and night**, click **Enable**.
3. Click **Save**.

### Automatically decline meetings when you're busy

1. In the Settings menu, click **Settings**.
2. Under **Labs > Automatically declining events**, click **Enable**.
3. Click **Save**.

### Change the default event duration

Google Calendar's default event duration is 30 minutes. If you want to change it:

1. In the Settings menu, click **Settings**.
2. Under **General > Default event duration**, choose 15, 30, 60, 90, or 120 minutes.
3. For even shorter meetings, select **Speedy meetings**. 30 minute meetings become 25 minutes; 60 become 50, 90 become 80, and 120 become 110.
4. Click **Save**.

### Show an additional time zone

This is helpful if you have to schedule meetings with people on the other side of the country. Google Calendar is limited to one additional time zone, though.

1. In the Settings menu, click **Settings**.
2. Under **General > Your current time zone**, click **Show an additional time zone**.
3. Choose your desired time zone.
4. Click **Save**.

### See what time it is around the world

This feature doesn't integrate as well with calendar, but it does show the current time in multiple time zones.

1. In the Settings menu, click **Settings**.
2. Under **Labs > World clock**, click **Enable**.
3. Click **Save**.

### Sync Google Calendar with your iPhone

You can sync your schedule to an iOS device with Google Calendar. Use your Gmail account to sign in.

### Sync Google Calendar with your Mac

You can sync your schedule to Apple’s Calendar program on a macOS computer. Use your Gmail account to sign in.


# Google Docs

Google Docs is a word processor in the cloud that allows us to collaboratively author and discuss fast-changing documents.

## <a id="setup">Setup</a>

Because Google Docs is a web application, there&rsquo;s no installation necessary.

## <a id="rules">Rules</a>

- **Abide by [the 18F Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct).** If you see anyone violating our Code of Conduct, please contact [Noah Kunin](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/messages/noah/) or [Hillary Hartley](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/messages/hillary/).

- Everything in our Google Drive, including Google Docs, can be FOIA&rsquo;ed.

- When you’re at work, make sure you're on the 18F Google Drive and not your private account, especially when working with outside partners. Official 18F documents must live on the GSA/18F shared drive for compliance reasons.

## <a id="usage">Usage</a>

- You can&rsquo;t publish docs to the web. You can&rsquo;t share docs with the public, only GSA or specific users. Even just to view.

- We cannot share Google Docs with other agencies. GSA employees can view and access Docs, but you&rsquo;ll need to ask in [#teamops](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/messages/team-ops) or [#it-issues](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/messages/it-issues) (for suggested programs) if you&rsquo;re working with another agency.

- Don't share docs with all at GSA. Instead, share with 18f-team and GSA will never auto-unshare them. (GSA will change your permissions if they are too open.) Docs that contain sensitive information will also be blocked via Cloudlock.

- Make sure you change the permission on new documents so that the proper people can view and edit them. If you put your documents or files in any of the folders within the [18F folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0B84F26FpUP0lR1B2VVNGSi1MMVk), the sharing settings should automatically be correct.

- Grant editing or commenting access to the entire team on a files by adding <mailto:18f-team@gsa.gov> in the Share menu. Disable the notification email if you don’t wish to bring it to the team’s attention right away. (You can also create and share whole folders; new files in a folder auto-inherit the sharing settings.)

- It is much better to add a Google Group of people to a document than individual email addresses because you can control access to the group from one location, particularly when someone leaves 18F.

- The Shift-Z command allows you to add folders to "My Drive" (shortcut) and to other folders at the same time - which is great for organizing documents in different ways. Documents in folders inherit the permissions of the folders that contain them.

- For people who have been frustrated by the narrowed sharing permissions, it's important to note that the restriction only goes one way. So, if you need to share documents with someone outside GSA, have them make a folder and add the people outside the GSA to it. Then you can create or move documents to that folder that everyone can see and you can add GSA people to that folder. Do not turn on the linkable sharing because it throws a warning.

## Tips

- Many people use Google Docs to collaboratively create documentation for their team/project/whathaveyou. This is fine for piecemeal documentation, but has proved untenable for larger amounts of interrelated content. In that case, migrate your documentation to GitHub for more granular control over edits via pull requests.

- Star or bookmark folders and documents you use regularly, or use search. (Searching in Drive goes through all of the files that have been shared with you.)

- If a folder looks empty, try refreshing your browser a few times. :shrug:


# Google Drive

Google Drive is a cloud storage and file backup system. We keep a lot of documentation on Google Drive, though we’re slowly switching material over to the Handbook.


## Setup

Because Google Drive is a web application, you don't need to install anything.

## Usage
We use Google Drive to keep track of documentation for different projects:

* The [18F Team Folder](https://drive.google.com/a/gsa.gov/folderview?id=0B84F26FpUP0lR1B2VVNGSi1MMVk&usp=sharing_eid) contains all of our Google Drive. If you haven't yet, click the option to ["Add to My Drive"](https://support.google.com/drive/answer/2375057?hl=en) for this folder.

* Everything in Google Drive can be FOIA’ed.

* Blog drafts are written in Google Drive in the Blog folder. [Instructions are here](https://github.com/18F/blog-drafts/blob/master/README.md).

* Every GSA employee can view and access docs. We cannot share Google Docs with other agencies. If you’re working with another agency, ask in #teamops or #it-issues for ways to share documents with folks at other agencies.

* Offline syncing for Google Drive/Docs has been disabled for GSA.

## Document permissions
The main way we collaborate on documents is by adding them to the 18F Team Folder in a relevant sub-folder. (You can make a new sub-folder if it wouldn't fit into the existing folders.) This automatically gives the document the right permissions and makes it easy for the rest of the team to find.

If you're working outside the 18F Team Folder, make sure you change the permission on new documents so that your collaborators can view and edit them.

## Security

If you're using a non-Google service and it requests access to your GSA Google Drive (such as to enable an integration feature), please deny that request. In other words, don't grant OAuth access to GSA Google Drive. Here's an example of what this kind of request might look like:

![don't click "allow"]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/google-drive/google-drive-oauth.png)

We have more explanation of why this is our policy in [this blog post about how we handle information security and third party applications](https://18f.gsa.gov/2016/05/13/how-18f-handles-information-security-and-third-party-applications/).

To be sure you haven't enabled this access accidentally in the past, you can check [Google's list of "Apps connected to your account"](https://security.google.com/settings/security/permissions), expand each item, and look for the Google Drive icon.

## Google Apps Scripts

To use a [Google Apps Script](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/), please fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/a/gsa.gov/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdOCtxCaSKJC87CedZW1FKGspMvnRzyOauMvKIOfrSV7PBdag/viewform).

## Tips

- **Finding recent documents** To find recently documents, use [this link](https://drive.google.com/drive/recent), which you can find by clicking on the "AZ" button and selecting "Last opened by me."


# Google Groups

We use Google Groups to manage team and interest-based email distribution lists and listservs (a list of listservs and groups 18F uses is [here](/general-contacts-and-listservs/)).

## Create a Google Group

1. Open the [GSA Service Desk Self-Service Portal](https://gsa.service-now.com/GSA_Self-Service/).
1. Under the **Make a Request** menu, click **Accounts and Access**.
1. Click **Google Groups/Sites Creation or Access**.
1. The service catalog auto-populates your name in the request. Note: If making a request on behalf of someone else, search for their name with the magnifying glass icon.
1. Complete the required fields. Note that the business justification can be brief.
1. If you're prompted for a supervisor, enter Ric (richard.l.miller). He can respond quickly.
1. Enter any other pertinent information in the comments.
1. Click **Order Now**.

## Manage a Google Group
To find the groups that you are in and manage any groups where you are an admin, visit [My Groups](https://groups.google.com/a/gsa.gov/forum/#!myforums).

## Tips

* You can't access public Google groups via the Google Groups website, but group owners can directly add your address to send and receive public group emails.

* While you can receive emails via the Google Group, be aware that your response will come from your main email account. If you're an admin for the group, however, you can select the group address when you are composing a response.

* People outside GSA can't access GSA Google groups via the Google Groups website, but email still works depending on the permissions. To adjust those permissions so non-GSA people can email your listserv, click on your listserv, then the "Settings" gear. Then "Group Settings." On the left menu of that screen, go to "Permissions" then "Basic Permissions." Click the dropdown box labeled "Post" and select "Public." Save your changes. 

You can subscribe to Google Groups with the following RSS feed URL: `https://groups.google.com/forum/feed/<GROUP_NAME>/msgs/rss.xml`


#Google Hangouts

Google Hangouts is an online video conferencing platform that allows us to add participation options to our calendar invites.

## Rules

**Abide by [the 18F Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct).** If you see anyone violating our Code of Conduct, please contact [Noah Kunin](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/messages/noah/) or [Hillary Hartley](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/messages/hillary/).

## Setup

Because Google Hangouts is a web application, there’s no installation necessary. For the best experience, use [Google Chrome.](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/)

You can change your avatar across Google Apps even though Google+ profile editing is restricted. Here's how:

 1. Open [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com).
 2. Click the circular account icon in the upper right corner.
 3. Click the **Change** link over your avatar.
 4. Update your profile photo.
 5. Click **Set as profile photo**.


## <a id="setup">Tips</a>

- You can [add a Hangout](/google-calendar/#tips) to Google Calendar invites.

- You can start a hangout from Slack by typing `/hangout`.

- You can use Google Hangouts to conference call, video conference, screenshare, and bridge to a telephone line (free domestically).

- You can make and receive free domestic phone calls from within Gmail or Google Hangouts. Just create a new number with your GSA account at google.com/voice

- Google Hangouts can now dial-out to include people in the Hangouts via audio-only. So you can be pretty on-the-fly so long as you have the number of either the one person who can’t get into the Hangouts, or a conference line where all the rest of the attendees are expected to call into. It’s great fun to get your virtual peeps together in Hangouts so you can see each other reacting, gesturing for wrap-up, raising hand to signal you’ll take the question being asked. etc. as if you were dialed in from the same (physical) conference room.

- Text chat, Google Hangouts On Air, and Google+ are disabled.

- To integrate teleconferencing into Gmail and Google Hangouts, [create a new number](https://www.google.com/voice/b/0?pli=1) with Google Voice that maps to your GSA-issued phone number.


### Hang out with people outside of GSA

You can host a Google Hangout with anyone outside of GSA. Set up the Hangout as you normally would, and then adjust the privacy settings:

1. Join the meeting.
2. Click on the meeting name in the top right corner.
3. Change the access to **Anyone with the link**.
4. Click **Close**.
