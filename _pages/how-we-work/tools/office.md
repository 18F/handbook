To request a Microsoft Office license for your Mac, see [Software](../software/#provisioning).

You should receive a reply from the Infrastructure team linking to this document when your access to an Office license has been granted, as well as an email from Microsoft. When you receive the latter, follow these instructions, as the ones in the email lack a certain specificity:

1. Go to the [Microsoft Volume Licensing Service Center](https://www.microsoft.com/Licensing/servicecenter/).

2. Click the Sign In button, then select the option "Sign in with your Microsoft account".

3. If you don't already have an account under your GSA email address, create a new account by clicking "Create one!":

4. Wait up to two hours after receiving the Microsoft email -- it takes that long for your license access to be granted to your new account.

5. Log in and navigate to "Downloads and Keys":

6. Select "Microsoft Office" for your platform, probably "for Mac Standard", and then click "Download".

8. Important! If you are a Mac user, make sure to change this selector from "32/64 bit" to "MAC":

9. Then click "Continue" and finally "Download" (a circle with a down-pointing arrow).
