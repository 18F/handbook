Google Calendar is an online calendar that provides us with a single point of reference for scheduling time.

## Setup

Because [Google Calendar]({{site.baseurl}}/google-calendar) is a web application, there's no installation necessary.

## Usage

TTS uses **shared calendars** for events, interviews, and "out of office" time. We also use shared calendars for working groups, guilds, and blog planning.

The following calendars are used for internal communication:

* [TTS Classes](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=gsa.gov_gi2e1fc66fh4v5in8ogsm0v8oo%40group.calendar.google.com): New hire and skill-bases training sessions.
* [TTS Guilds and Working Groups](https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=gsa.gov_o1aqcv28k1f0nmca5bkch8los4%40group.calendar.google.com): Meetings and other events pertaining to working groups and guilds.

**18F also uses these shared calendars:**

* [18F Events](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=gsa.gov_3rapmucstu32ma18da84el20ug%40group.calendar.google.com): Team-wide events, start dates, standups, and so on.
* 18F Interviews: New hire interviews.
* [18F Out of office](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=gsa.gov_bth7useo0eeiicjgos2di6ph8k%40group.calendar.google.com): In addition to <em>officially</em> requesting time off in <a href="/gsa-internal-tools/#hr-links">HR Links</a>, please also add an event on the Google calendar "18F Out of Office" and invite yourself, so we all know when youâ€™re gone.

You can add the above calendars to your Google calendar by clicking on the link to launch the HTML view and then clicking on `+Google Calendar` on the bottom right of the screen.

## Tips

- To add a video call to your calendar invite: create an event, click **Edit event**, and under **Video call** click **Add video call**. Google gives the call a default name, but you can click **Change name** to customize it. Then click **Save**. ([Demonstration.]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/google-calendar/2.gif))
- You can't share calendars with anyone outside GSA. You can share individual invites, but not whole calendars.

### Scheduling meetings with other people

Here are a few ways you can use Google Calendar to find times to meet with other people:

- To view someone else's calendar, type their name in the lefthand column under "other calendars."
- Create an event, add everyone who needs to attend as a guest, and click "Suggested Times" or "Find a Time."
- Set up blocks of time that people can reserve. Just select "Appointment slots" after you choose a window of time (this is especially useful for researchers).

### Specify working hours

Specifying your working hours will mark you as busy during non-working hours. Your colleagues will get a warning if they try to schedule you outside those times.

1. In the Settings menu, click **Settings**.  ![Setting Menu]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/google-calendar/1.png)  
2. **Under General > Working hours**, select **Show a warning to other people when they invite me to an event outside my working hours**.
3. Specify the days and times you prefer to work.
4. Click **Save**.

### Change default event durations

Google Calendar's default event duration is 30 minutes. If you want to change it:

1. In the Settings menu, click **Settings**.
2. Under **General > Event Settings**, choose 15, 30, 60, 90, or 120 minutes.
3. For even shorter meetings, select **Speedy meetings**. 30 minute meetings become 25 minutes; 60 become 50, 90 become 80, and 120 become 110.
4. Click **Save**.

### Change default event permissions

Google Calendar's default event permissions prohibit guests from modifying the events to which they're invited. Update this if you'd rather send more flexible invitations.

1. In the Settings menu, click **Settings**.
2. Under **General > Event Settings**, choose **Default guest permissions**.
3. Choose your desired default guest permissions

### See what time it is around the world

This feature doesn't integrate as well with calendar, but it does show the current time in multiple time zones.

1. In the Settings menu, click **Settings**.
2. Under **Labs > World clock**, click **Enable**.
3. Click **Save**.

### Sync Google Calendar with your iPhone

You can sync your schedule to an iOS device with Google Calendar. Use your Gmail account to sign in.
