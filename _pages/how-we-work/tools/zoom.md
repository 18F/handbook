Zoom is a video-conferencing tool used by 18F for large meetings, such as the weekly all-hands.
We recommend it for a video calls with over twenty participants. Use of the native Zoom app is
usually much lighter on machine resources (especially the CPU) than Google Hangouts.

Zoom lives on the web at https://zoom.us/

## Setup

If you've been invited to a Zoom meeting, you've likely been given a `zoom.us` URL. Clicking
that URL will take you to a page that lets you join the meeting using your web browser or to
download the Zoom client app for your computer. We generally recommend installing the native 
client if you have time, as it's often smoother and faster to use than the web client.

To install the client natively on your Mac, download it [here](https://zoom.us/client/latest/zoomusInstaller.pkg)
and double click the .pkg file. Accept the defaults and click next until it completes the install.
It will open the app following installation, where you can set your defaults. 

## How to create a Zoom account

Go into the [#admins-zoom](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/messages/admins-zoom) channel and ask @erik. 
He will log into 18F Zoom console and send you an invitation via email. Click on the link to accept
the invitation, set your password, and log in. 

Alternatively, you can create your own account [here](https://zoom.us/signup). However, if you 
think that you will ever need to host a meeting longer than 40 minutes, you should just request 
an invitation so that you belong to the 18F organization. If you already have an account, you
can still be added to the 18F organization in the future. 

## How to host a meeting

Due to how we currently have our Zoom licenses set up, the instructions are different depending on
whether your meeting is intended to be shorter or longer than 40 minutes.

If you log into Zoom, under the tab "My Profile," you will see a Personal Meeting ID. This ID contains 
a URL, which you are free to give to anyone who wants to join your meeting. This URL is static and does
not change. If you need a unique URL, you can create one in the "My Meetings" tab. 

### For meetings shorter than 40 minutes (Free tier)

Create a Zoom account (see above) and [log in](https://zoom.us/signin). You'll see a link that allows
you to both create and moderate meetings. This moderation panel can be really useful for doing things
like muting everyone (since there's always someone who leaves their mic open accidentally).

Unfortunately, the "shorter than 40 minutes" is a hard limitation on our Zoom accounts. Once your
meeting reaches 40 minutes, it's over! [_RENEW! RENEW!_](http://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/22080/what-did-the-crowd-think-it-took-to-win-renewal-in-carrousel)

These meetings do not need to be scheduled in advance and you may hold as many as you like. 

### For meetings longer than 40 minutes (Pro tier)

Let @erik know as far in advance as possible in [#admins-zoom](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/messages/admins-zoom).
Currently 18F only has two Pro licenses that allow for meetings longer than 40 minutes. What 
this means to you is that longer meetings need to be scheduled and are generally a "first come, 
first served" scenario. Zoom meetings are tracked on a Google Calendar called "Zoom Scheduling." 

On the morning of your meeting, Infrastructure will promote your account to Pro Status. If there are multiple 
meetings scheduled that day, your account will be promoted as soon as the Pro account is available. We try to schedule 30 minutes on each side of the requested time to allow you ample setup time as well as padding in the event that your meeting runs long. If no one is scheduled after you, you will likely remain in Pro status until the following morning. 

To schedule a meeting, please post your request in [#admins-zoom](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/messages/admins-zoom).
The request should include the date, time, and applicable time zone. If your meeting is recurring, 
please include the end date. At this time, no recurring meetings are being scheduled beyond December 2017. 
Please revalidate the meeting request in [#admins-zoom](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/messages/admins-zoom).

### Frequently Asked Questions

Q: If I am hosting a Free meeting and it looks like it will go long, can you promote me to Pro? 
A: No. Once your meeting has started, it will not convert to a Pro meeting without restaring the meeting. 
That being said, Pro meetings will convert to Free if the license is needed elsewhere. 

Q: Will 18F be getting more Pro licenses? 
A: Yes! More licenses are currently in the works as part of the larger SaaS buy. 

Q: I don't need moderation and want to host a longer meeting. Is there a link that I can just use? 
A: Not yet. We hope to have one or two generic accounts that can be used on demand. Of course, there is
the risk that someone else may be using it at that time and you could interrupt their meeting. We're 
working on logistics for managing these scenarios. 

Q: Will you notify me when you upgrade my account to Pro? 
A: Sometimes. This is time permitting and more at your request. 

Q: How much advance notice do you need for a longer meeting?
A: As much as possible. If there is no one on the calendar, and Infrastucture is available, you account
could be converted quickly. But please ask in advance whenever possible.
