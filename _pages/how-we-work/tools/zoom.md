Zoom is a video-conferencing tool used by 18F for large meetings, such as the weekly all-hands.
We recommend it for a video calls with over twenty participants. Use of the native Zoom app is
usually much lighter on machine resources (especially the CPU) than Google Hangouts.

Zoom lives on the web at https://zoom.us/

## Setup

If you've been invited to a Zoom meeting, you've likely been given a `zoom.us` URL. Clicking
that URL will take you a page that lets you join the meeting using your web browser, or
downloading the Zoom client app for your computer. We generally recommend installing the native 
client if you have time, as it's often smoother and faster to use than the web client.

_(Instructions for installing the native client go here.)_

## How to create a Zoom account

Go into the [#wg-videoconf](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/messages/wg-videoconf) channel and ask someone.
Probably Erik. In fact, I'm going to tell you to ask Erik because he's been kind enough to respond
to people in the past, and I am now going to totally exploit that kindness in getting him to edit
this page with better instructions. _We love you, Erik. Sorry._

## How to host a meeting

Due to how we currently have our Zoom licenses set up, the instructions are different depending on
whether your meeting is intended to be shorter or longer than 40 minutes.

### For meetings shorter than 40 minutes

Create a Zoom account (see above) and [log in](https://zoom.us/signin). You'll see a that allows
you to both create and moderate meetings. This moderation panel can be really useful for doing things
like muting everyone (since there's always someone who leaves their mic open accidentally).

Unfortunately, the "shorter than 40 minutes" is a hard limitation on our Zoom accounts. Once your
meeting reaches 40 minutes, it's over! [_RENEW! RENEW!_](http://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/22080/what-did-the-crowd-think-it-took-to-win-renewal-in-carrousel)

### For meetings longer than 40 minutes.

_Need an official explanation for this one, but in the meantime, ask in [#wg-videoconf](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/messages/wg-videoconf)_
