You can get started with a trial version [immediately](https://www.sketch.com/). Upgrade to the full version whenever you get the license. Visit [#sketch](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/messages/sketch) on Slack for help and sharing tips.

## Getting a license

Send an email to [tts-software@gsa.gov](mailto:tts-software@gsa.gov) with:

- Your [computer name](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/find-your-computers-name-and-network-address-mchlp1177/mac)
- If you've used Sketch at TTS before

Note Sketch is registered to the machine, so this needs to be done if you get a new one.

## Plugins

One thing that's different about using Sketch at GSA is that Sketch plugins are not impossible to obtain, but might be more time-consuming than time-saving. Each Sketch plugin is treated like a [new software request]({{site.baseurl}}/software/), and must undergo review by GSA IT review. So far, we haven't found much that we can't accomplish without plugins.
