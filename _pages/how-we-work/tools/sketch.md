You can get started with a trial version [immediately](http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/). Upgrade to the full version whenever you get the license. Visit [#sketch](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/messages/sketch) on Slack for help and sharing tips. One thing that's different about using Sketch at GSA is that Sketch plugins are not impossible to obtain, but might be more time-consuming than -saving. Each Sketch plugin is treated like a [new software request]({{site.baseurl}}/software), and must undergo review by GSA IT review. So far, we haven't found much that we can't accomplish without plugins.
