One thing that's different about using Sketch at GSA is that Sketch plugins are not impossible to obtain, but might be more time-consuming than time-saving. Each Sketch plugin is treated like a [new software request]({{site.baseurl}}/software/), and must undergo review by GSA IT review. So far, we haven't found much that we can't accomplish without plugins.
