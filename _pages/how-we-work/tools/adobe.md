title: Adobe Creative Cloud (CC)

Visual designers often need Creative Cloud (CC) for access to high-powered vector control in Illustrator, image editing in Photoshop, print layout in InDesign, or video-editing tools. Creative Cloud licenses are more limited, so please don't request access unless you really do need it for your work.
