title: Adobe Acrobat and Creative Cloud (CC)
---

Visual designers often need Creative Cloud (CC) for access to high-powered vector control in Illustrator, image editing in Photoshop, print layout in InDesign, or video-editing tools. Creative Cloud licenses are limited, so please don't request access unless you really do need it for your work.

You can request Acrobat Pro or Creative Cloud by submitting [a Software Request through the GSA IT Help Desk](https://gsa.service-now.com/sp/?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=1bfdfdca78d3a400ce3ddff91a64940b). Make sure to specify that you are on a Mac.
