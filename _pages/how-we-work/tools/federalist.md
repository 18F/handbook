We use [Federalist](https://federalist.18f.gov) to build websites.  

## Documentation 

* [Federalist Documentation](https://federalist.18f.gov/pages/using-federalist/)

## Setup 

* Set up your [GitHub](https://handbook.18f.gov/github/) account.  
* Log in at the [Federalist app](https://federalistapp.18f.gov/).  

## Rules 

* TTS teams can use Federalist for internal or TTS-specific projects without cost.  However, if the site is part of a project you're doing for another agency, it must be included in and paid for by the agreement with that agency.  

* For 18F staff only - The Outreach team is responsible for 18F's web presence. If you are looking to create an 18F microsite (`xyz.18f.gov`), such as a guide or resource, the Outreach team will need to approve it. *Where to start:* Tell us about the site that you want to create by [filling out this form](https://goo.gl/forms/gnknCoYSRIF0gGrA3) or by going to the [Outreach page](https://handbook.18f.gov/outreach/#f-branding-and-microsites-approval) to learn more. If you have any questions, head over to [#outreach](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/messages/outreach/) on Slack.
