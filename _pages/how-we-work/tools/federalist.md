We use Federalist to build websites.  

## Documentation 

* [Federalist Documentation](https://federalist-docs.18f.gov/)

## Setup 

* You'll need to set up your [GitHub](https://handbook.18f.gov/github/) account first.  
* Then go to the [Federalist homepage](https://federalist.18f.gov) and log in in the top right.  

## Rules 

* TTS teams can use Federalist for internal or TTS-specific projects without cost.  However, if the site is part of a project you're doing for another agency, it must be included in and paid for by the agreement with that agency.  

* For 18F staff only - The Outreach team is responsible of 18F's web presence. If you are looking to create a 18F microsite (`xyz.18f.gov`), like a guide or resource, the Outreach team will need to approve it. Where to start: Tell us about the site you want to create by [filling out this form](https://goo.gl/forms/gnknCoYSRIF0gGrA3) or by going to the [Outreach page](https://handbook.18f.gov/outreach/#f-branding-and-microsites-approval) to learn more. If you have any questions, head over to #outreach on Slack.
