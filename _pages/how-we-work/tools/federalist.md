We use Federalist to build websites.  

## Documentation 

* [Federalist Documentation](https://federalist-docs.18f.gov/)

## Setup 

* You'll need to set up your [GitHub](https://handbook.18f.gov/github/) account first.  
* Then go to the [Federalist homepage](https://federalist.18f.gov) and log in in the top right.  

## Rules 

* TTS teams can use Federalist for internal or TTS-specific projects without cost.  However, if the site is part of a project you're doing for another agency, it must be included in and paid for by the agreement with that agency.
