  - You can read more about Chrome's protocol handlers at [The Complete Guide to Google Chrome Handlers](http://www.ashout.com/complete-guide-to-google-chrome-handlers/)

- **If you go by a different name, create an alias.** You can create an alias to have a different email address, like if you go by something other than your legal name.

- **Create filters.** You can create filters to manage the influx of automatic emails you’ll be receiving (like Region X Communications). You can select "add a label" and automatically “archive" or put messages into different folders.

- **You can set your photo** for your Google profile in [Gmail settings](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/35529?hl=en).
