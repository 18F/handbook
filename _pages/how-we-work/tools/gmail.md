We use Gmail for email.

## Usage

You can access your email from <https://mail.google.com> or <http://email.gsa.gov>.

## Tips

- **For basic Gmail tips and best practices** check out the [Email with Gmail](https://insite.gsa.gov/portal/content/638210) InSite page.

- **Enable clickable `mailto:` links in Chrome**:

  - Navigate to your inbox, https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox
  - Click on the interlocking diamonds icon on the right in your address bar
  - In the dialog, _Allow mail.google.com to open all email links_
  - Then click _Done_, as show below:

  - You can read more about Chrome's protocol handlers at [The Complete Guide to Google Chrome Handlers](http://www.ashout.com/complete-guide-to-google-chrome-handlers/)

- **If you go by a different name, create an alias.** You can create an alias to have a different email address if you go by something other than your legal name. [Go to the GSA Service Now self-service page](https://gsa.service-now.com/GSA_Self-Service/) and submit a "GSA Generic Request" (Home > Make a request > Other requests > GSA Generic Request) asking for the email alias that you want.

- **Create filters.** You can create filters to manage the influx of automatic emails you’ll be receiving (like Region X Communications). You can select "add a label" and automatically “archive" or put messages into different folders.

- **You can set your photo** for your Google profile in [Gmail settings](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/35529?hl=en).
