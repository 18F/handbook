- procurements

Buying something over $10,000 means that the Office of Acquisition (OA) needs to be involved in the process. A warranted Contracting Officer (CO) will help you through the process and get you what you need. This Acquisition Guide will get you started and explain the steps you will take throughout the process.

## Acquisition Guide

**1. Intake Form**
  1.Things you should know before submitting the Intake Form:
    - Please note you will need to complete and attach the [technical requirements](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S_qfFI09uTth2Sx8RgWKqvlcOHxzCmdfn5h0DQYClc8/edit?usp=sharing) before submitting this form. It is crucial that your need is clear and well-defined prior to submitting your request.
    - Make sure you have a Contracting Officer Representative (COR) on the team that is [FAC-COR](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HzbEv6yQn6pWYl1MDImeLW6ShedcRsekSCBe54Nsnc8/edit#heading=h.aizxbe137goh) certified (this is someone who will help manage the buy)
    - We will have some questions about funding (no-year, multi-year, ASF/FCSF funding, estimated budget, etc.). Please be prepared to answer these questions. 
    2. You will also need your director’s approval prior to submitting the form.
    3. Fill out the [Intake Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1bSoFcljv-hmUJsSCK04AsdIh03hor_T4m1yjopild6w/edit)
to submit your request for acquisition support.

**2. Initiation/Kick-off Meeting**
  1. The OA will contact you within 3 business days of submitting the intake form to set up some time with you and your team to review the technical requirements, roles/responsibilities, project milestones, etc.
  
**3. Preparing the Acquisition Package

*There are lot of documents that need to be created before we can buy anything. Below we explain the purpose of these documents and who is responsible for creating them. Check back soon and we will have templates for each document!*

  1. Statement of Work (SOW)/Performance Work Statement (PWS)/Statement of Objectives (SOO)
    - **What it is:** It summarizes what it is you’re buying, why the government needs it, etc.
    - **Who drafts it:** The customer (you) 
  2. Market Research Report
    - **What it is:** It outlines the current state of the market for your need and who can provide this product/service. This may include releasing a Request for Information (RFI), where we survey the marketplace and directly ask potential vendors about what we are planning to buy. FYI, an RFI could add to the overall timeline. 
    - **Who drafts it:** The customer (you) 
  3. IGCE
    - **What it is:** It details an estimate of the cost for the product/service 
    - **Who drafts it:** The customer (you) 
  4. PR/IX Funding Document
    - **What it is:** Ensures you have the funding for this buy
    - **Who initiates it:** The customer (you) 
  5. Specific Justifications (if needed)
    - Limited Sources or Brand Name
      - **What it is:** Strong defense of why the particular brand/vendor/etc. is the ONLY SOURCE that can meet your need.
      - **Who drafts it:** CO and the customer (you) 
    - Contract Type (for Labor Hour and Time and Material (T&M))
      - **What it is:** May be required on why the need cannot be bought using a firm fixed price
      - **Who drafts it:** CO
    - Acquisition Plan
      - **What it is:** This is a required document for buys over $250k. It includes a brief statement of our need, the market research findings, the expected cost, vendors that can provide a solution (sources), competition, evaluation of potential vendors (evaluation criteria), contract type (firm fixed price, labor hour/time and materials, etc), any risks, projected timeline, etc.
      - **Who drafts it:** CO & the customer (you) - a lot of the information is compiled from many of the steps above
    - Request For Quote (RFQ)
      - **What it is:** This is the public facing document where we explain to vendors what we need, how they need to submit quotes, and how we will evaluate their submissions, etc.
      - **Who drafts it:** CO (with some help from the customer (you))
    - Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP), if applicable
      - **What it is:** This is used to manage the contractor’s performance and ensure they are delivering the results specified in the Performance Work Statement (PWS). It provides details on how the government will review the contractor’s work to ensure we are getting what we are paying for. 
      - **Who drafts it:** CO & the customer (you)
**4. Posting the Solicitation**
  1. We documented what we need and what is required per federal and agency regulations, so now we can post it to the public and see who can deliver!
  2. The COs have several venues where we can post our RFQ and supporting documentation: [GSA ebuy](https://www.ebuy.gsa.gov/advantage/ebuy/start_page.do), [FedBizOpps](https://www.fbo.gov/), and/or [Github](https://github.com/). The CO will be responsible for this action.
**5. Evaluating Vendors**
  1. Hopefully, we received interest from industry and have multiple responses from the vendor community. We will then review each quote from the vendors and evaluate in accordance with the evaluation criteria stated in the RFQ. Prior to evaluating vendors’ quotes, the customer (you) are responsible for setting up a Technical Evaluation Team made up of two to three technical SMEs. 
  2. Technical Evaluation Plan 
    - **What it is:** Instructs the Technical Evaluation Team how to evaluate each quote in accordance with the criteria stated in the RFQ.
    - **Who drafts it:** CO
  3. Consensus Report
    - **What it is:** Summarizes the technical evaluation team’s results from their evaluations and their technical recommendation for the award.
    - **Who drafts it:** The customer (you) and their Technical Evaluation Team
  4. Price Analysis
    - **What it is:** Determination that the submitted quotes are fair and reasonable. The government may use various resources to make this determination (IGCE, Multiple Award Schedule pricelists, CALC tool, industry resources, etc.).
    - **Who drafts it:** CO
**6. Making Award**
  1. Award Decision Memo
    - **What it is:** Using the Technical Evaluations Team’s consensus report and the price analysis, the CO makes the decision on which vendor will provide the best value to the government.
    - **Who drafts it:** CO
  2. The CO will utilize a contract writing system to make the contract award and have the signed form (by both the government and contractor) with the official contract number (Procurement Instrument Identifier).
**7. Post-Award
  
You’re probably thinking, “Yay! The award has been made, and I have a contract! All the work is done.” WRONG! The fun has just begun. It is the government’s responsibility to monitor the contractor’s performance to ensure the contract’s articulated outcomes are being achieved. In addition to monitoring the contractor’s performance, other post-award tasks may include: managing vendor/government relationships, issuing technical direction, reviewing and approving invoices, writing inspection/performance reports, tracking payments to indicate remaining balance of funds, etc. 

We assign a COR (most likely from the customer’s team) to aid in the post-award contract management. 
  1. COR Delegation Letter
    - **What it is:** Details the responsibilities of the COR for the contract.
    - **Who drafts it:** The CO prepares the letter and the COR reviews and signs it.
