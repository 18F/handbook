If TTS needs to purchase something over $10,000, a warranted Contracting Officer (CO) from the Office of Acquisition (OA) will need to help you through the process.

Here are the steps involved in an acquisition over $10,000:

## 1. Gather materials and submit an intake form

- Complete the [technical requirements](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S_qfFI09uTth2Sx8RgWKqvlcOHxzCmdfn5h0DQYClc8/edit?usp=sharing). You'll need to attach this document to your intake form, and it's crucial that your need is clear and well-defined.
- Identify a [FAC-COR](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HzbEv6yQn6pWYl1MDImeLW6ShedcRsekSCBe54Nsnc8/edit#heading=h.aizxbe137goh)-certified Contracting Officer Representative (COR) on the team to help manage the buy.
- Know what funding you have; the CO will have some questions about funding (no-year, multi-year, ASF/FCSF funding, estimated budget, etc.), and the process goes more smoothly if you're prepared to answer these questions.
- You will also need your director’s approval prior to submitting the form.
- Once you have that information, fill out the [Intake Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1bSoFcljv-hmUJsSCK04AsdIh03hor_T4m1yjopild6w/edit) to submit your request for acquisition support.

## 2. Initiation/kick-off meeting

The OA will contact you within 3 business days of submitting the intake form to set up some time with you and your team to review the technical requirements, roles/responsibilities, and project milestones.
  
## 3. Preparing the acquisition package

*There are lot of documents that need to be created before we can buy anything. Below we explain the purpose of these documents and who's responsible for creating each one. Check back soon and we will have templates for each document!*

**Documents you'll need for any acquisition**

The **customer (that's you!) is responsible** for drafting or initiating each of these supporting documents:

- **Statement of Work (SOW)/Performance Work Statement (PWS)/Statement of Objectives (SOO)** summarizes what you’re buying and why the government needs it.
- **Market Research Report** outlines the current state of the market for your need and who can provide this product/service. This may include releasing a Request for Information (RFI), where we survey the marketplace and directly ask potential vendors about what we are planning to buy. An RFI can add to the overall timeline. 
- **IGCE** details an estimate of the cost for the product/service.
- **PR/IX Funding Document** ensures you have the funding for this buy.

**Specific justifications (if needed)**

For each of these documents, the **Contracting Officer will work with you** to develop more specific justifications or documentation if needed:

- **Limited Sources or Brand Name**: Strong defense of why a particular brand/vendor/etc. is the **only source** that can meet your need.
- **Contract Type (for Labor Hour and Time and Material (T&M))**: May be required to explain why the need cannot be bought using a firm fixed price.
- **Acquisition Plan**: This is a required document for buys over $250k. It includes a brief statement of our need, the market research findings, the expected cost, vendors that can provide a solution (sources), competition, evaluation of potential vendors (evaluation criteria), contract type (firm fixed price, labor hour/time and materials, etc), any risks, projected timeline, etc.
- **Request For Quote (RFQ)**: This is the public facing document where we explain to vendors what we need, how they need to submit quotes, and how we will evaluate their submissions, etc.
- **Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP)**, if applicable: This is used to manage the contractor’s performance and ensure they are delivering the results specified in the Performance Work Statement (PWS). It provides details on how the government will review the contractor’s work to ensure we are getting what we are paying for. 

## 4. Posting the solicitation

1. We documented what we need and what is required per federal and agency regulations, so now we can post it to the public and see who can deliver!
2. The COs have several venues where we can post our RFQ and supporting documentation: [GSA ebuy](https://www.ebuy.gsa.gov/advantage/ebuy/start_page.do), [FedBizOpps](https://www.fbo.gov/), and/or [Github](https://github.com/). The CO will be responsible for this action.

## 5. Evaluating vendors

Hopefully, we received interest from industry and have multiple responses from the vendor community. We will then review each quote from the vendors and evaluate in accordance with the evaluation criteria stated in the RFQ. Prior to evaluating vendors’ quotes, the customer (you) are responsible for setting up a Technical Evaluation Team made up of two to three technical SMEs.

Vendor evaluation includes these documents:

- Technical Evaluation Plan: Instructs the Technical Evaluation Team how to evaluate each quote in accordance with the criteria stated in the RFQ.
  - **Who drafts it:** CO
- Consensus Report: Summarizes the technical evaluation team’s results from their evaluations and their technical recommendation for the award.
  - **Who drafts it:** The customer (you) and their Technical Evaluation Team
- Price Analysis: Determination that the submitted quotes are fair and reasonable. The government may use various resources to make this determination (IGCE, Multiple Award Schedule pricelists, CALC tool, industry resources, etc.).
  - **Who drafts it:** CO

## 6. Making award

1. Award Decision Memo
  - **What it is:** Using the Technical Evaluations Team’s consensus report and the price analysis, the CO makes the decision on which vendor will provide the best value to the government.
  - **Who drafts it:** CO
2. The CO will utilize a contract writing system to make the contract award and have the signed form (by both the government and contractor) with the official contract number (Procurement Instrument Identifier).

## 7. Post-Award
  
You’re probably thinking, “Yay! The award has been made, and I have a contract! All the work is done.” WRONG! The fun has just begun. It is the government’s responsibility to monitor the contractor’s performance to ensure the contract’s articulated outcomes are being achieved. In addition to monitoring the contractor’s performance, other post-award tasks may include: managing vendor/government relationships, issuing technical direction, reviewing and approving invoices, writing inspection/performance reports, tracking payments to indicate remaining balance of funds, etc. 

We assign a COR (most likely from the customer’s team) to aid in the post-award contract management. 

1. COR Delegation Letter: Details the responsibilities of the COR for the contract.
  - **Who drafts it:** The CO prepares the letter and the COR reviews and signs it.
