18F is experimenting with providing support for mentorship!  This is formally a part of 18F Learn but it is supported across multiple chapters and business units.

## Getting started

If you'd like to participate in mentorship, it's as simple as reaching out to folks in [#mentorship](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/messages/mentorship)!  Someone will be in touch to review the general information found below and identify what you'd like to focus on and whether you would like to mentor someone, be mentored, or both.

Please note that regardless of how you'd like to participate in mentorship, it is subject to the availability of other folks also interested in participating and focusing on your area/skill of interest.

Lastly, the [#mentorship](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/messages/mentorship) is also a great place to go to chat with other folks who are currently participating in mentorship or have mentorship experience.  You can learn more about what's currently happening, ask questions, etc.

## Administrative information

We ask that folks commit to a minimum of **6 weeks** to start with once we're able to find a match for people.  The reason behind this it that allows for enough time to give the mentorship pair a chance to gel and develop a cadence and relationship with one another.  It's usually a little slow going in the beginning especially if you haven't collaborated with one another before; this is okay!  We want to make sure folks give things a chance and make a concerted effort.

However, we also don't want folks feeling like they're being forced to do something that isn't working for them or that they are stuck with someone that isn't a great fit.  Whether or not you choose to continue as a pair after the 6 week time period is over is entirely up to both you and your partner.

### Areas of focus

What you and your partner focus on for mentorship is largely up to you, though it must be related to our work and our mission at 18F.  If you are able to tie it directly to your project work, there is the added benefit that the mentoring time is also project work.  While this is preferred as it helps us with cost recoverability, it is not required.  More importantly, you should focus in an area that you are both passionate about!

How you and your partner structure your mentorship time is also almost entirely up to the both of you.  We recommend that folks devote between a half hour to an hour a week to mentorship, but you're free to make other arrangements so long as you have supervisor and project approval.

### Tocking time

The time spent in mentorship can be Tocked one of two ways.  If you and your partner are focusing on something neither of you is working on directly related to project work, please Tock the time to  `71 Training / Prof Dev - Non Billable`.

If you are focusing on something related to either person's project work, you and your partner should speak with the project Engagement Manager to confirm the time can be covered by the budget.  You are likely a resource already accounted for in the project budget, but your mentoring partner may not be.  If there is support, then you should be able to Tock your time to the project line item you normally use for regular billable work (but defer to the project Engagement Manager in case there is a different line item to use).

If there is not support in the budget but you are still cleared to spend time with mentorship, then you should also use the `71 Training / Prof Dev - Non Billable` line item.
