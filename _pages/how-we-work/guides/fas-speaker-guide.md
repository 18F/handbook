This guide was created by GSA's Office of Strategic Communications (OSC) to teach TTS employees how to evaluate invitations from external event organizers.

## Type of speaking events

A few notes about the types of speaking engagements you might receive and how to process them:

### Media requests.
If you are contacted by a newspaper, tv station, radio station, podcast, or blog, send directly to press@gsa.gov. It’s okay to respond to the sender (cc-ing press@gsa.gov) thanking them for the invite and letting them know that press@gsa.gov will handle the request.

### Formal invites.
This includes requests to speak at customer events such as an agency’s acquisition conference and/or industry request. They all require formal approvals as outlined in the [approvals guide](https://handbook.18f.gov/attending-conferences/).

### Less formal requests.
Invitations to speak at a college class (or any educational institution) or anything you’re doing in your official capacity as a GSA employee (where you will be identified as working for GSA) requires approvals outlined in the [approvals guide](https://handbook.18f.gov/attending-conferences/).

## Accepting invitations

You have been invited to speak at an upcoming industry event or agency conference. Great! Now what? The first thing to do when you get an invitation to speak is to decide whether or not to accept the invitation. Talk with your supervisor. Challenge yourselves to come up with good reasons to speak rather than having no good reasons not to speak. It is always okay to decline speaking invitations. GSA gets tons of them!

Here is the basic checklist of considerations:

- Am I available on the date and time requested?
- Am I the subject matter expert?
- Can I speak with authority on this topic?
- Is there someone else at TTS (or another office) better positioned to speak with authority on this topic?
- Are there other TTS or GSA representatives already attending who could support this request?
- Does TTS have anything new to say about the topic?
- Who is the audience? Not just the organizer,  consider the attendees: Who are they? Is it a diverse audience?
- What does the event organizer want/expect? What do we want? Why do we want to speak?
- What are the top three messages we want to convey?
- Do I have time to get this approved? (Allow at least 20 days.)
- Is there a conflict or the appearance of a conflict of interest speaking at this event?
- Does the organization do business or seek to do business with GSA?

If you are not familiar with the organization issuing the invitation or with the particular event at which you have been invited to speak, feel free to reach out to our OSC liaison [Drew Jack](mailto:drew.jack@gsa.gov)

Then, if the invitation sparks your interest, arrange a call with the host and find out things like:

- Who is sponsoring the event?
- Why do they want you/GSA to participate?
- Who else is on the agenda? Who would be speaking right before and after you?
- Will there be press at the event/at the specific session? (Read this document about handling press at events.)
- Will gifts (meals, awards, souvenirs, honoraria, travel expenses) be provided? What is the cost of the items (even if they are free for all attendees or free for all speakers)?
- Is there a fee to attend? Is the fee waived for government attendees/speakers?
- If it is a panel or roundtable: Who are the other participants? Who is the moderator? What questions will be asked?

## You Want to Accept. Now What?

Once you have determined you have good reasons to speak and have decided to accept the invitation, you have to get approval to participate. If the invitation is for a media interview, work with GSA’s press office to coordinate. If it is for a public speaking engagement -- with or without media -- all  requests to attend a conference, including for GSA-hosted conferences, must go through the [speaker approval process] (https://handbook.18f.gov/attending-conferences/).
