Do you need software to do your job or make sure TTS is running smoothly? Follow the steps below to access software we own or request a software purchase of under \$10,000.

If you need to purchase more expensive software, see [procurements over $10,000]({{ site.baseurl }}/procurements-over-10000/).

## Get access to software we already have

[**Search the IT Standards list.**]({{site.baseurl}}/software/search/)

If the software you are looking for is in the [TTS inventory](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12pfcEIEXaJTjIKex-3wnI89erIvgKf9B_XpGkDl6qsM/edit#gid=0), send an email to [tts-software@gsa.gov](mailto:tts-software@gsa.gov) requesting a license for the software you need. The TTS Saas Project Manager will contact you within 1-2 business days.

If TTS does not have licenses, GSA might. In order to check the GSA IT Catalog:

1. [Start a Software request](https://gsa.servicenowservices.com/sp/?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=1bfdfdca78d3a400ce3ddff91a64940b)
1. Scroll toward the bottom of the page to where it says “Enter Software Name Here”.
1. In the dropdown menu, start to type the name of the software you need.

If the name pops up, it means GSA has already purchased it. If your software is in the Catalog, fill out the rest of the form to request a license.

_Note: If you're looking for MS Office, see [this page]({{site.baseurl}}/office/)._

## Approvals

All software in use at GSA needs to be approved through the IT Standards process. There are a few exceptions:

- Free and open source development packages
  - In general, open source development libraries are exempt from IT Standards review.
  - See the [CIO GSA Information Technology (IT) Standards Profile](<https://www.gsa.gov/directive/gsa-information-technology-(it)-standards-profile>) (section 2c) for more details.

## Purchase new software

Here at TTS, we want to stay current and take advantage of as many emerging technologies as possible. We believe that getting the software you need to do your job should not be difficult, time-consuming or stressful. If the software is not in the [TTS inventory](https://app.smartsheet.com/b/publish?EQBCT=cf3124067fda44bbbe1471fe985d96b7) or GSA IT Catalog (or if there are no licenses available), the TTS Tech Portfolio will work with you to meet your needs as best as possible.

### Step 1: Request within TTS

Use the [TTS Tech Portfolio Software Request Form](https://forms.gle/w3MqKNMmLj1vbpWv8) to get a _New Software (consult)_. Please ensure that your justification in the Google Form is detailed, so it can be used to request FITARA approval.

### Step 2: Find or get an ATO

An Authority to Operate (ATO) is the result of the Assessment and Authorization process where someone (the Authorizing Official) accepts the risk as it pertains to cybersecurity. The ATO typically has certain conditions (such limiting use of certain data, needing to be on a VPN, etc) and as long as the software is used under those conditions, the Authorizing Official accepts the risk. Based on the nature of changing threat landscap, ATOs have an expiration date and will need to be assessed again before a new authorization is issued.

To check for an ATO, you need to go to [check the IT Standards list]({{site.baseurl}}/software/search/). If the software you are purchasing has a valid ATO listed in GEAR, then you can proceed with the rest of the process. You should save a copy of the ATO to your desktop so you can attach it to the request later.

If the ATO is expired or you cannot find it in GEAR, you can post in the Slack channel [#tts-tech-portfolio](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/messages/tts-tech-portfolio/) to ask if there is an updated ATO. If there is no ATO or the ATO is expired, you will need to go through the ATO process to ensure your software is approved by security. The ATO process can take 4-6 weeks and [costs money](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PokRIGaGl04sxMxEHGwMIRaJDx4OPEXpJ7g69ekDdz8/edit#gid=1451563242z) and there is no guarantee it will be approved. If your need is urgent, try to find something in the [IT Standards]({{site.baseurl}}/software/search/) list that is already approved and meets your needs.

### Step 3: [Submit a micropurchase request.]({{site.baseurl}}/purchase-requests/)

## Other lists and approval processes

Typically, ATOs are for data and systems. They are required for any GSA information system that hosts GSA data. Not everything falls into that category, but they still need approval. Rather than being given the approval to Operate, they are given an Approval to Use (ATU). An ATU is a risk-based approval process for usage of services, features or funcstion on already ATO'd information systems or platforms. Both of these processes are explained in the [ATO & ATU Tech Talk Briefing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rjv7eiPSpjv4imX8Pi4ghRyS-aYb48ln/view?usp=sharing).
