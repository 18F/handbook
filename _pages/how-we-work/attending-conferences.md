TTS encourages all staff to attend conferences, speak at events and focus on professional development and training opportunities.

## Attending Events

TTS usually attends events in one of five ways.

### I’m speaking at a conference but not attending conference events.
***Note: speaking events require a minimum of 25 days advance notice.***

This section outlines how to request to speak at a conference event.

1. Meet with your supervisor to discuss the conference speaking opportunity.

1. Submit [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeK5RVrqFR80Jn7BBRPN-jvd5hFoB_derFcPq4OeyU2oMNVoA/viewform?c=0&w=1) and alert the training team that you want to speak at a conference.  The short five to six question form will help the training team understand your needs and keep all of TTS’s requests in one place.

1. Within two business days, a training team member will reach out to you directly and be your point of contact through the entire process, including creating your Salesforce Event Tracker request.  Please do not input an Event Tracker request until the training team has reached out to you.

1. Watch your email and wait for Event Tracker approval. If you have questions about the status ask in slack #training-conferences or send a slack DM to your training POC.

While you wait!   You can  . . . Make Travel Arrangements in Concur (if needed). You don’t have to wait until your conference is approved to make your arrangements in Concur.  Most travel reservations will automatically cancel if not approved.  If you book outside of Concur for the conference hotel, you are responsible for cancelling any reservation, if your event is not approved. You are responsible for any cancellation fees, if you fail to follow the conference hotel cancellation policy.  You can ask questions in [#travel](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/messages/travel/) or during [travel office hours](https://sites.google.com/a/gsa.gov/tts-office-hours/) with Ethan Hepner 11:30-12:30 ET
