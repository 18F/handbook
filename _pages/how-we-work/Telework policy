Telework provides flexibility for employees. It improves morale and productivity by allowing for greater collaboration among peers. 18F recognizes these benefits and encourages working from home with administrative supervisor (or designee) approval. This policy adheres to and is in conjunction with [GSA's mobility and telework policy](http://www.gsa.gov/graphics/staffoffices/GSAteleworkpolicy.pdf).
