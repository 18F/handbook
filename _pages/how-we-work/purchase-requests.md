If you’re looking to have TTS purchase anything – whether it’s training, a conference, software, or services, you have come to the right place! Your request will be considered and, if approved, purchased by either the TTS Office of Acquisition (OA) or TTS Operations (Ops).

## Training and Conferences (regardless of cost)

Any purchases for training, see the [training section](https://handbook.18f.gov/attending-conferences/#im-attending-training-that-is-not-at-a-conference). Any purchases for conferences, see the [conference section](https://handbook.18f.gov/attending-conferences/#im-attending-a-conference-including-training-offered-before-or-after-the-conference). 

*Any questions? Slack [#travel](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/messages/travel/)or book office hours [here](https://sites.google.com/a/gsa.gov/tts-office-hours/).*

## Purchases under $10,000 

### C2

[C2](http://requests.18f.govis used for all purchase requests under $10,000). In order to use C2, you will need to get an account set up. Fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfZfBRRO_mBz2wwBHJTufi6kWONQhc64otCAYBCKV8keDvXVA/viewform) and you will be set up within one to two business days. Once you are set up in C2, you will be able to make either an event request (for training and conferences)* or a purchase request (for anything else). All requests must be approved by a supervisor before submitting in C2. Do not make a purchase on your own because you will not be reimbursed! Please follow the below instructions to make your request.   

Please note that for training and conferences, someone from the TTS Ops team will enter the request in C2 on behalf of the requestor. Please be sure to follow the steps in the training section and conferences section linked above. 

C2 user tip: 

* **Purchase Type:** Software/Services/Etc.
* **Product Name and Description:** Include the specifics of what you are requesting.
* **Justification:** The justification section is very important. This is how you will get approval from TTS for what you need. It needs to be a strong justification for why you need it and you must include how it is different from something we have already procured and is available for use.
* **Link to Product:** Provide a link to the product website, if available.  
* **Cost per unit:** If the product costs less than $3,500 per unit, then you must enter the unit price (and not the total price) here. If the product costs over $3,500 per unit (still must be under $10,000), then you will need to enter the amount as $3,500 and put the actual amount in the description for now (we are working to update C2 accordingly).
* **Quantity:** Include the quantity of what you are requesting.
* **Additional Information:** Include your office/chapter/portfolio and your supervisor’s name.  

After the C2 request is created:

* Add your supervisor as an observer in C2 by scrolling all the way to the bottom where it says “Observers” and typing in their name or email. (If they have never used C2, you may need to request access for them, like you did for yourself at the beginning of the process.) 
* Then, supervisor adds a comment “Approved” in your C2 request. Please note that for OPP purchases, the OPP Director’s approval is required in addition to the portfolio supervisor’s approval. 

### Business Cards

To make best use of our resources, we use business cards sparingly. However, if you expect to use them for outreach or a specific meeting with partners, you can request standard GSA business cards, which don’t reflect TTS or 18F branding.

To initiate your request, 

* First head to [envisionprintservices.com](http://envisionprintservices.com/). Verify your email, then create an account for yourself. Use a password that you are comfortable sharing with a member of the TTS Ops team, as they will need to later log in as you and make the purchase. 
* After your account is set up, fill in the required information, finalize the design of your cards, and review your proof. Continue to checkout, choosing the quantity you'd like and adding the address that you'd like your business cards mailed to.
* Once you are on the final step of the order and credit card information is requested, it’s time to request approval. Create a new purchase request in C2, and include your account credentials under "Link to Product". Your order in C2 will be reviewed by the TTS Director of Operations, and once approved, a member of the TTS Ops team will log into your Envision account and release payment. Your business cards will arrive 7-10 business days after that.

If you want TTS/18F branding, you must purchase your own business cards. However, please get a final approval from the TTS Outreach team before placing the order. 

### Office Supplies

Anyone working in an 18F office may request a purchase of office supplies by creating a new purchase request in C2. Be sure to add one of the TTS Ops team points of contact (POC) below as an observer to your request:

* Chicago - Ethan Heppner
* DC - Matt Spencer
* New York - Ethan Heppner
* San Francisco - Ethan Heppner

Once the request is placed, the designated TTS Ops team member will make the determination as to whether or not to recommend your request for approval by the TTS Director of Operations.
