title: Purchase requests
---

**Short version:** Use the [micropurchase request form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd-GoOE9xWWfJvdZNRP3SE7mj5ysI_RfM8brxdG8YpyJV9yKA/viewform) for requesting purchases under $10,000.

## How it works

Your request will be considered and, if approved, purchased by either the [TTS Office of Acquisition (OA)]({{site.baseurl}}/oa/) or the [Tech Portfolio]({{site.baseurl}}/tech-portfolio/).

Some types of purchases are handled differently. See these pages for guidance about purchasing:

- [Conferences, events, and training]({{site.baseurl}}/conferences-events-training/)
- [Software]({{site.baseurl}}/software)
- [Equipment]({{site.baseurl}}/equipment)

Upon completing the form, you will get an automated email, which confirms the details you entered, outlines any further actions you need to take, and loops in everyone who would need to approve your type of request. Different types of requests have different timelines for completion, but you should expect a response from whoever is identified to review your request within two business days.

## Business cards

To make best use of our resources, we use business cards sparingly. However, if you expect to use them for outreach or a specific meeting with partners, you can request standard GSA business cards, which don't reflect TTS or 18F branding.

To initiate your request,

1. Head to [envisionprintservices.com](http://envisionprintservices.com/). Verify your email, then create an account for yourself. Use a password that you are comfortable sharing with a member of the TTS Ops team, as they will need to later log in as you and make the purchase.
1. After your account is set up, fill in the required information, finalize the design of your cards, and review your proof. Continue to checkout, choosing the quantity you'd like and adding the address that you'd like your business cards mailed to.
1. Once you are on the final step of the order and credit card information is requested, it's time to request approval through the [micropurchase request form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd-GoOE9xWWfJvdZNRP3SE7mj5ysI_RfM8brxdG8YpyJV9yKA/viewform). Your order will be reviewed by the TTS Director of Operations, and once approved, a member of the TTS Ops team will log into your Envision account and release payment. Your business cards will arrive 7-10 business days after that.

If you want TTS/18F branding, you must purchase your own business cards. However, please get a final approval from the TTS Outreach team before placing the order.

## Office supplies

1. If you have access to a GSA office, check the supply rooms for what you need.
1. If not available, fill out the [micropurchase request form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd-GoOE9xWWfJvdZNRP3SE7mj5ysI_RfM8brxdG8YpyJV9yKA/viewform).
1. The designated TTS Ops team member will determine whether or not to recommend your request for approval by the TTS Director of Operations.

## Domain renewals

Requesting a domain renewal is much easier than requesting software. The dotgov Billing Point of contact will reach out to the Technical Point of Contact about a month before the domain will expire asking them if they want the domain to be renewed. If the domain is to be renewed, the domain point of contact will be asked to submit the [micropurchase request form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd-GoOE9xWWfJvdZNRP3SE7mj5ysI_RfM8brxdG8YpyJV9yKA/viewform). After you submit the form, follow the instructions for next steps.

## Certificates

[General information](https://before-you-ship.18f.gov/infrastructure/certs/)

Purchasing SSL/TLS/ECA certificates fall somewhere between a software request and a domain renewal request. There is no ATO required for SSL Certificates, however, FITARA approval is still required. To obtain SSL/ECA Certificates, you will need to submit the [micropurchase request form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd-GoOE9xWWfJvdZNRP3SE7mj5ysI_RfM8brxdG8YpyJV9yKA/viewform) and follow the instructions. Then, the Tech Portfolio and TTS OA Director will work with OCIO to get FITARA approval.

## Services

Examples of services TTS has procured:

- Engineering support
- Design services
- 3PAO service

Please follow the recommended steps below when ordering services under $10,000:

1. For all requests, submit the [micropurchase request form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd-GoOE9xWWfJvdZNRP3SE7mj5ysI_RfM8brxdG8YpyJV9yKA/viewform) to initiate the request process. It will instruct you on next steps.
2. You will need to make a copy of this [RFQ template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u9HZeUN8uEkyJbcQO6EWyyzawNgw4yijD4jV5h8C5mQ/edit?usp=sharing), fill it out, and attach the link to the micropurchase request form.
3. After you submit the form, the TTS Micro-Purchase Project Manger and the OA Director will review the RFQ. Please be ready to address any questions, comments, or feedback at your earliest convenience.
4. After the RFQ is approved by the OA Director, you will send it to the appropriate vendor(s) and cc the TTS Micro-Purchase PM. When sending the RFQ to vendor(s), keep in mind:
   - If they've been government employees who worked in TTS within the past two years, we can't hire them.
   - Spread the wealth - this is not a formal rule or policy, but you don't want to go back to the same person for every purchase, because that raises flags.
   - Make sure the vendor can accept payment via government purchase card (aka credit card) - this seems easy but isn't always the case.
5. Receive a quote from the vendor. When reviewing the quote, please keep in mind:
   - The requirement cannot exceed the micro-purchase threshold for the same service within a twelve-month period.
   - You can't pay for similar services from both vendor A and B if the scope is the same and the combined cost exceeds the micro-purchase threshold within a twelve-month period. This is considered splitting purchases.
   - You need to avoid scope creep (adding extra work to the original agreement) that would go over the threshold.
   - If you need any assistance with negotiations, please contact the TTS Micro-Purchase PM and the OA Director.
6. Once the quote is received, the Micropurchase PM and OA Director will review the quote and ask for more quotes, clarifications, or proceed with the purchase.

## Behind the scenes

1. People submit micropurchase request form
1. Request goes into [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dO1qz9TFAWFgGqteRL10Bbq4JSKskXzdwlgAeKtMYj8/edit#gid=2001741130)
1. Request is routed for the relevant point of contact to review:
   1. For software/domains, request is marked as `Pending TTS Software Team review`. The [TTS Tech Portfolio]({{site.baseurl}}/tech-portfolio/) reviews to check if it has an ATO and prior [FITARA]({{site.baseurl}}/fitara/) approval (check the [FITARA Trello board](https://trello.com/b/KklMfNO0/gsa-it-fitara)) - if not on we need to go through approval process.
   1. For Equipment/office supplies, request is marked as `Pending TTS equipment manager review`. The TTS equipment manager verifies that the requested items are not already in stock somewhere else (in TTS or GSA supply inventories).
   1. For services and other requests, request is marked `Pending TTS Micropurchase manager review`. The OA Micropurchase PM will verify all requirements have been met.
   1. Business cards do not require any special review and pass automatically to AO approval.
1. Once the review in the previous step is complete, the responsible party will change the request status to `Pending Supervisor Approval` if the request will be paid for out of a particular team's budget (e.g. cloud.gov) or `Pending AO Approval` if the request will be paid for out of a general budget (e.g. the TTS SaaS budget).
   1. If a request is marked `Pending Supervisor Approval`, it must be approved by the supervisor identified by the requerstor before proceeding. An email is automatically sent which includes a link that allows the supervisor to approve or disapprove.
1. The Approving Official (AO) will be the final approver for all Micropurchase requests. Upon arriving at this step, an email is automatically sent which includes a link that allows the AO to approve or disapprove.
   1. The Director of the TTS Tech Portfolio is the AO for all software/domain requests.
   1. The Director of Business Operations is the AO for all equipment, office supply, and business card requests.
   1. The Director of TTS' Office of Acquisition is the AO for services and all other requests.
1. Once the AO approval has been approved, the status is automatically moved to `Pending P-card Purchaser` and an email generated to the card holder. The card holder will verify that the request is something they can move forward with and can then make the purchase.
   1. For software/domains, the purchase card holder is a member of the [TTS Tech Portfolio]({{site.baseurl}}/tech-portfolio/) team.
   1. For Equipment/office supplies, the purchase card holder is the TTS equipment manager on the TTS Business Operations team.
   1. For services and all other requests, the purchase card holder is the OA Micropurchase PM.
1. Once the purchase card holder has purchased the request, they must mark the status as "Completed". A copy of the purchase information will be copied into the Pegasys Bot Export Sheet tab of the Micropurchase Request Sheet. The following fields will need to be completed in that same tab:
   1. Actual purchase amount/recurring purchase amount if recurring.
   1. The purchase card holder's credit card alias and Pegasys User ID.
   1. A link to the receipt, which must have view access granted to all GSA.
1. A log will be generated in Pegasys within a few hours of entry of all the above information. The log will show up in the card holder's Pegasys inbox. They must verify that all information is correct and then approve. Adjustments will need to be made in case a purchase needs to be split across multiple accounting lines.
1. If the approval in Pegasys is processed within 5 business days of the purchase, and the log has only one accounting code, the log should be auto-reconciled and no further action is needed. Otherwise, it will need to be manually reconciled.

### Other notes

The logic of which role is responsible for each type of purchase is set in the OnSubmit.gs file of [this script](https://script.google.com/a/gsa.gov/d/1pmQUdF6wWuC_p19U5JGg_FE0gCNLdI6z7p1V0ZspZ6t9mS5prLIN151I/edit?mid=ACjPJvG8EfcsHcc7dSMr_zjmsRi7zmB0MynQhhi1sXDTpxe4Atz-dkBiF9D21__0Uf6ZTFpUk7Jp6OofDFI0PBPLJ0hFlEyeZl46chLZg6wG_9257Aq-gpL5YgJGsihoiduyJYzKl0IZais&uiv=2). However, the individual who occupies each role is determined by the [Configuration tab of the Micropurchase Request Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dO1qz9TFAWFgGqteRL10Bbq4JSKskXzdwlgAeKtMYj8/edit#gid=46395844), and can be easily changed in case one of the responsible parties is out of the office.

Note: it is good practice to set this a few days in advance, as updates here only change the routing for new requests and not existing ones. However, an existing request's status can be changed to "Resubmitted instructions" which will reassign approvers (though this will revert to request back to its initial status).
