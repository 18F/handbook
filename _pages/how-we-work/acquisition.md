TTS Office of Acquisitions handles three different types of acquisitions for two different types of clients:

They buy off the Agile BPA for TTS customers, they manage acquisitions for other parts of TTS using the National Capital Region (NCR) as the contracting office, and in limited circumstances, they can procure things themselves for other parts of TTS.

Each of these has it's own process. It is many steps, and it is very important that everything is done correctly.
