Role: Account Manager
Account Managers (AMs) at 18F are the connective tissue across 18F projects that allow us to build long-term relationships with partners and consistently help 18F project teams deliver value. Because of the number of projects they are involved with, AMs serve as hubs of institutional knowledge for project teams. 
Different roles at different times

The role of the account manager changes over the course of each project. For example, account managers are critical in the initial business development process (before an agreement even exists), then as a strategic advisor and resource while projects are underway.
