GSA issues every TTS employee a badge, laptop, and phone. Your MacBook should be ready before your first day, but your phone may not be. The Ops Team submits phone requests to IT on your behalf, and you'll receive a confirmation email within a few weeks when your phone is ready for pickup.

## Badge

Your GSA badge, also known as a PIV card, allows you to get in and out of GSA buildings and avoid security lines.

Although some of our employees are based out of a specific office, your badge can be permissioned for multiple GSA buildings. Email [hspd12.security@gsa.gov](mailto:hspd12.security@gsa.gov) to start this process, which usually takes a few days. After you receive an email confirmation, you'll need to visit the security office in each new building to activate your card.

GSA processes new badges every Wednesday. When your badge is ready, you’ll receive an email (in both your personal and GSA emails) from `HSPD12Admin@usaccess.gsa.gov` containing four steps. Please skip to step four, which details how to schedule an appointment and pick up your badge, and bring the password in step three. To check on the status of your GSA badge, you can email [hspd12.security@gsa.gov](mailto:hspd12.security@gsa.gov).

### Distributed employees

Badges are shipped to your local GSA office. You will receive an email once your badge has been shipped. At that point, you can make an appointment to pick it up. Your badge may be available during your orientation -- send an email to [hspd12.security@gsa.gov](mailto:hspd12.security@gsa.gov) to save yourself a trip. You may also ask your orientation leader to show you where to pick it up.

## Laptop

TTS employees are issued an Apple MacBook Air/Pro computer. Note that this is not the norm for GSA.

### Rules

**[Require a password](http://support.apple.com/kb/PH18669?viewlocale=en_US)** when your computer goes to sleep or shows a screensaver.

**Lock your computer before leaving it.** Press the **Control + Shift + Power** keys on newer MacBooks or **Control + Shift + Eject** on older MacBooks with optical drives. If you use Alfred, you can open Alfred and type lock.

**Back up your machine.** Make a copy of your startup disk before you encrypt it. Your Mac has a built-in backup system called Time Machine (accessible from System Preferences) that will regularly back up the main disk to any compatible network server, connected hard drive, or partition you choose. Please ensure Time Machine backups are encrypted by selecting the **Encrypt backups** checkbox when you choose the destination disk.

**Check that your hard drive is [encrypted with FileVault](http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT4790).** GSA IT sets up your laptop with FileVault encryption. You won't need to (and shouldn't) change this, but you can check it in your System Preferences just to see that it's there and properly set up.

**Encrypt all portable media that will connect to any TTS system.** You can apply FileVault encryption to removable USB drives and external hard drives by right-clicking the drive on your desktop and clicking **Encrypt**. You must choose a strong password you can remember, as your drive will require the password to mount and retrieve data once encrypted.

**Browser extensions need to be pre-approved.** See [the Chrome page on InSite](https://insite.gsa.gov/topics/information-technology/do-it-yourself-self-help/google-g-suite-apps/google-chrome-browser#Chrome%20Extensions) for more information.

### Tips

- Run the [shell script](https://github.com/18F/laptop) which will turn your Mac into an awesome web development machine.

## Phone

TTS employees are issued an Apple iPhone.  The TTS Talent Team will already have submitted a request to GSA IT for your work phone before you join TTS. Within a few weeks of starting at TTS, you should receive a confirmation email letting you know that your phone is ready for pickup. If you work in an office besides D.C. or are remote, please contact the [Talent Team](mailto:tts-talentteam@gsa.gov) when you receive this email and a team member have your phone mailed to you.

### Rules

- GSA IT will ask for your Apple ID and password. **Do not send your personal Apple ID or password to IT.** Ask them to set up a new Apple ID with your GSA email address, or set one up for yourself and use [Fugacious](https://fugacious.18f.gov/) to send them your password securely. (Never share passwords over email.)

- **Activate [Find My iPhone](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH2697?locale=en_US).** If you're on an Android phone, activate [Android Device Manager](https://www.google.com/android/devicemanager).

- **After GSA IT provisions your phone, set up two-factor verifications.** Email <mailto:hspd12.security@gsa.gov> and ask them to add your work cell phone number (which you may or may not have) and your personal cell phone number to your GCIMS profile. You can learn more about using your phone for two-factor authentication in our [Slack]({{site.baseurl}}/slack), [GitHub]({{site.baseurl}}/github), and [Gmail]({{site.baseurl}}/gmail) guides. For two-factor authentication with this applications, you can use SMS, [Authy](https://www.authy.com/), or [Google Authenticator](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447?hl=en).

### Tips

- **You can use your phone to access your email.** You should be prompted to sign in with your ENT username and password. Note that the GSA IT ServiceDesk does not support this connection, so please do not ask them about it as they will reject your request.
- **[You can tether to your laptop to iPhone](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204023)** for internet access when you're on the go.
- If you can't send email with your new work iPhone, create a new email and check the From field. If it's a jumble of letters and numbers `@secure.mass360.com`, tap on it to change it to your `@gsa.gov` email address. Then go **Settings > Mail > Default Account > GSA Account** to switch the default address.
- If you stop getting email on your phone and can't log into your account, you may need to regenerate your [GKey](https://gkeygsa.appspot.com/request). The Apple Mail app uses your GKey as your password.
- To reduce waste, GSA IT will [disable mobile service for inactive accounts](https://insite.gsa.gov/portal/content/663074). The consumed minutes is the metric used to determine activity, so if you only use the phone for data, you'll still need to make an occasional call on your mobile phone to prevent the account from going inactive.
- If you need help with your phone, call the GSA IT Help Desk at 1-866-450-5250.

## Software

See the [software](../software/) page.

## Mice, keyboards, and trackpads

If you are based in an office, you can check out mice, keyboards, and trackpads to assist you in your work. They are already available, so there is no need to make a purchase request in C2. The procedure for requesting, however, varies by office.

#### DC or remote

Make your request [here](https://docs.google.com/a/gsa.gov/forms/d/1d2Qa1KpjTGkn8yK_2cTY5UgMAtsJKQkNgQsqU_WBFKs/viewform). A member of the TTS Business Operations Team will reach out to you.

If you'd like to check out Apple peripherals (for example, a Magic Mouse or wireless keyboard), make your request [here](https://docs.google.com/a/gsa.gov/forms/d/1d2Qa1KpjTGkn8yK_2cTY5UgMAtsJKQkNgQsqU_WBFKs/viewform).

#### Chicago

Reach out to [Ethan Heppner](mailto:ethan.heppner@gsa.gov) via email, he will assist you within two business days.

#### San Francisco

TBD

## Equipment to accommodate disability

GSA provides equipment to accommodate an injury or disability under these conditions:

- You have supporting medical documentation for the need for a certain piece of equipment.
- You only need the equipment to do your work.

To purchase this type of equipment, go to <https://requests.18f.gov/> and attach a doctor's note. If you have questions, ask in [#equipment](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/messages/equipment) or [tts-equipment@gsa.gov](mailto:tts-equipment@gsa.gov).

## Repairs

If TTS-issued equipment fails due to manufacturer defects or accidental damage:

- TTS will cover the full cost of repairs or replacement of the device, regardless of the warranty status of the device. This applies to all TTS-issued hardware and peripherals.

- Employees are responsible for informing Team Ops in [#equipment](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/messages/equipment) or [tts-equipment@gsa.gov](mailto:tts-equipment@gsa.gov) of the damage or need for repair by the close of business one business day following the damage.
- If either your laptop or your phone is in need of repair, please go to [#equipment](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/messages/equipment) or [tts-equipment@gsa.gov](mailto:tts-equipment@gsa.gov) for advice. They will likely either ask you to take it to an Apple Store (TTS will pay for the repairs), or ship it back to the DC or Chicago offices-- the TTS Business Operations team will ship you a new laptop.

- If you need to take your laptop to the Apple Store, you can check to see if it's under warranty with the hardware serial number [here](https://checkcoverage.apple.com/). If it is not under warranty, Team Ops will walk you through how to take care of the cost for repair.
- If you need to leave your laptop for repairs at the Apple Store, double check that your hard drive is [encrypted with FileVault](http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT4790). As a reminder, GSA IT sets up your laptop with FileVault encryption. You can check it in your System Preferences to see that it's there and properly set up.

## <a id="stolen-or-lost">Lost or stolen equipment</a>

If TTS-issued equipment is lost or stolen, follow these mandatory steps.  Employees must follow the GSA procedures for lost or stolen equipment or missing PIV cards, and alert TTS in [#equipment](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/messages/equipment):

1. Inform [#equipment](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/messages/equipment) within one business day of learning the equipment is stolen or lost.
2. Call 911 or a local police station when you suspect theft has occurred.
3. Get and keep a copy of the police report in case you have to provide it to the Federal Protective Service (FPS) or your regional Information Systems Security Officer (ISSO). Provide as much information as possible.
4. Call the IT Service Desk at 1-866-450-5250. An agent will create a ticket and initiate the process of wiping data off any stolen mobile device or laptop. Alternatively, you can report a lost or stolen item via [GSA Service Desk](https://gsa.service-now.com/).
5. Call your FPS using contact information provided in the link.
6. Contact your regional ISSO using contact information provided in the link.
7. If your equipment is returned to you, it may have been tampered with and should not be used. Return the equipment to GSA IT so they can inspect it, and if necessary, re-image it.

TTS will replace stolen or lost equipment once a copy of the police report is sent to Team Ops and the employee confirms they contacted FPS. If you lose your PIV card, you will also need to fill out this [lost access card form](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0SnS9Ferbdnc3p6cmdOT05mUGNwdlNLMncxME5VZFlOOFhz/view) and email it to [hspd12.security@gsa.gov](mailto:hspd12.security@gsa.gov)
