GSA issues every 18F employee a badge, laptop, and phone. Your MacBook should be ready before your first day, but your phone may not be. The Ops Team submits phone requests to IT on your behalf, and you'll receive a confirmation email within a few weeks when your phone is ready for pickup.

## Badge

Your GSA badge, also known as a PIV card, allows you to get in and out of GSA buildings and avoid security lines.

Although some of our employees are based out of a specific office, your badge can be permissioned for multiple GSA buildings. [Kathryn Connolly](https://18f.slack.com/messages/@kathryn/) can submit paperwork to start this process, which usually takes a few days. After you receive an email confirmation, you'll need to visit the security office in each new building to activate your card.

GSA processes new badges every Wednesday. When your badge is ready, you’ll receive an email (in both your personal and GSA emails) from `HSPD12Admin@usaccess.gsa.gov` containing four steps. Please skip to step four, which details how to schedule an appointment and pick up your badge, and bring the password in step three. To check on the status of your GSA badge, you can email [accesscard@gsa.gov](mailto:accesscard@gsa.gov).

### Distributed employees

Badges are shipped to your local GSA office. You will receive an email once your badge has been shipped. At that point, you can make an appointment to pick it up. Your badge may be available during your orientation -- send an email to [accesscard@gsa.gov](mailto:accesscard@gsa.gov) to save yourself a trip. You may also ask your orientation leader to show you where to pick it up.

## Laptop

All 18F employees are issued an Apple MacBook Air/Pro computer. Note that this is not the norm for GSA.

### <a id="laptop">Rules</a>

**Install [Managed Software Center](/managed-software-center/).** This is how we'll send you software updates, optional software titles, and Apple updates that won't break your system.

**Install [ClamXav](/clamxav)** immediately. This software will be **automatically** pushed to your system by the Managed Software Center, so you **must** complete that installation first. This is your antivirus software.

**[Require a password](http://support.apple.com/kb/PH18669?viewlocale=en_US)** when your computer goes to sleep or shows a screensaver.

**Lock your computer before leaving it.** Press the **Control + Shift + Power** keys on newer MacBooks or **Control + Shift + Eject** on older MacBooks with optical drives. If you use Alfred, you can open Alfred and type lock.

**Back up your machine.** Make a copy of your startup disk before you encrypt it. Your Mac has a built-in backup system called Time Machine (accessible from System Preferences) that will regularly back up the main disk to any compatible network server, connected hard drive, or partition you choose. Please ensure Time Machine backups are encrypted by selecting the **Encrypt backups** checkbox when you choose the destination disk.

**Check that your hard drive is [encrypted with FileVault](http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT4790).** GSA IT sets up your laptop with FileVault encryption. You won't need to (and shouldn't) change this, but you can check it in your System Preferences just to see that it's there and properly set up.

**Encrypt all portable media that will connect to any 18F system.** You can apply FileVault encryption to removable USB drives and external hard drives by right-clicking the drive on your desktop and clicking **Encrypt**. Please choose a strong password you can remember, as your drive will require the password to mount and retrieve data once encrypted.

## Phone

All 18F employees are issued an Apple iPhone. The Ops Team will already have submitted a request to GSA IT for your work phone before you join 18F. Within a few weeks of starting at 18F, you should receive a confirmation email letting you know that your phone is ready for pickup. If you work in an office besides D.C. or are remote, please contact [Shawnique Muller](mailto:shawnique.muller@gsa.gov) when you receive this email and she'll have your phone mailed to you.

### Rules

GSA IT will ask for your Apple ID, password, and GKey.

- **Do not send your personal Apple ID or password to IT.** Ask them to set up a new Apple ID with your GSA email address, or set one up for yourself and use [Fugacious](https://fugacious.18f.gov/) to send your password along securely. (In general, you should never share your password over email. In this case, however, the provisioning process requires it, so you can make an exception.)
- To retrieve your GKey, visit <http://gkey.gsa.gov/> and click the "Reset gKey" button.

**Activate [Find My iPhone](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH2697?locale=en_US).** If you're on an Android phone, activate [Android Device Manager](https://www.google.com/android/devicemanager).

**After GSA IT provisions your phone, set up two-factor SMS verifications.** Email <mailto:accesscard@gsa.gov> and ask them to add your work cell phone number (which you may or may not have) and your personal cell phone number to your GCIMS profile. You can learn more about using your phone for SMS two-factor authentication in our [Slack](/slack), [GitHub](/github), and [Gmail](/gmail) guides. You can also use [Authy](https://www.authy.com/) or [Google Authenticator](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=google%20authenticator%20app) with these applications.

### Tips

- **You can use your phone to access your email.** You should be prompted to sign in with your ENT username and password. Note that the GSA IT ServiceDesk does not support this connection, so please do not ask them about it as they will reject your request.
- **[You can tether to your laptop to iPhone](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204023)** for internet access when you're on the go.
- If you can't send email with your new work iPhone, create a new email and check the From field. If it's a jumble of letters and numbers `@secure.mass360.com`, tap on it to change it to your `@gsa.gov` email address. Then go **Settings > Mail > Default Account > GSA Account** to switch the default address.
- If you stop getting email on your phone and can't log into your account, you may need to regenerate your [GKey](https://gkeygsa.appspot.com/request). The Apple Mail app uses your GKey as your password.
- If you need help with your phone, call the GSA IT Help Desk at 1-866-450-5250.

## Business cards

Different 18F team members have different solutions for business cards. At this time, you must purchase your own business cards. You can purchase them from [GovBusinessCards](http://www.govbusinesscards.com/) or [Moo](http://www.moo.com/).

You can request [GSA business cards](https://cap.18f.gov/gsa18f/procurements/new), which are free and don't reflect 18F's branding. Upon receiving a request, a member of Team Ops will log into Envision Business Cards, then reach out to you to retrieve the information you want on the card.

## Requests

Ops is testing [C2](https://cap.18f.gov) for requesting office supplies, computer hardware, approved software, trainings, and other items under $3,500.

To make a request:

1. Check [the list of 18F's purchased software](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14hEWuhlhKi-EbAFUcy1tuoEejl-7DNiBTI57ZbIQF9w/edit?ts=5727c8ba#gid=0) to see if we have accounts/licenses already.
    1. If yes, reach out to the person/team listed for that item to get access. You/they may need to come back here to request more seats.
    1. If no, keep going!
1. Open [cap.18f.gov](https://cap.18f.gov/).
1. Click **Sign in with MyUSA** to connect with Google.
1. Scroll down and click **Allow**.
1. Once you’re logged in, click **New 18F request** to create and submit your request. If you don't see this link, it's possible that you haven't been set up as a member of 18F yet. Post a request in #c24ops for access or if you have any questions about how to use C2.
1. After submitting your request, it will be reviewed by the Director of Operations. The Director of Operations must approve all requests before they are purchased.
1. After your request is approved, it will typically be purchased by a purchase card holder on the operations team. Do not purchase yourself unless you are instructed to do so by a member of the operations team.

If you're requesting software that no one else at 18F uses yet, be sure you have written approval from [#infrastructure](https://18f.slack.com/messages/infrastructure) first. If it's software that runs directly on your laptop, speak with [Kimber Dowsett](https://18f.slack.com/messages/@kimber). Ops will not approve software without Infrastructure clearance.

If you'd like to check out Apple peripherals (for example, a Magic mouse or wireless keyboard), make your request [here](https://docs.google.com/a/gsa.gov/forms/d/1d2Qa1KpjTGkn8yK_2cTY5UgMAtsJKQkNgQsqU_WBFKs/viewform).


## Equipment to accommodate disability

GSA provides equipment to accommodate an injury or disability under these conditions:

- You have supporting medical documentation for the need for a certain piece of equipment.
- You only need the equipment to do your work.

To purchase this type of equipment, go to <https://cap.18f.gov/> and attach a doctor's note. If you have questions, ask in [#equipment](https://18f.slack.com/messages/equipment).

## Repairs

If 18F issued equipment fails due to manufacturer defects or accidental damage:

- 18F will cover the full cost of repairs or replacement of the device, regardless of the warranty status of the device. This applies to all 18F-issued hardware and peripherals.
- Employees are responsible for informing Team Ops in [#equipment](https://18f.slack.com/messages/equipment) of the damage or need for repair by the close of business one business day following the damage.
- If either your laptop or your phone is in need of repair, please go to [#teamops](https://18f.slack.com/messages/teamops/) for advice. They will likely either ask you to take it to an Apple Store (18F will pay for the repairs), or ship it back to 18F (we'll ship you a new laptop).

## <a id="stolen-or-lost">Lost or stolen equipment</a>

If 18F issued equipment is lost or stolen, follow these mandatory steps.  Employees must follow the GSA procedures for lost or stolen equipment or missing PIV cards, and alert 18F in [#equipment](https://18f.slack.com/messages/equipment):

1. Inform [#equipment](https://18f.slack.com/messages/equipment) within one business day of learning the equipment is stolen or lost.
2. Call 911 or a local police station when you suspect theft has occurred.
3. Get and keep a copy of the police report in case you have to provide it to the Federal Protective Service (FPS) or your regional Information Systems Security Officer (ISSO). Provide as much information as possible.
4. Call the IT Service Desk at 1-866-450-5250. An agent will create a ticket and initiate the process of wiping data off any stolen mobile device or laptop. Alternatively, you can report a lost or stolen item via [GSA Service Desk](https://gsa.service-now.com/).
5. Call your FPS using contact information provided in the link.
6. Contact your regional ISSO using contact information provided in the link.

18F will replace stolen or lost equipment once a copy of the police report is sent to Team Ops and the employee confirms they contacted FPS.

## Tips for better passwords

As you set up your 18F accounts and devices, here are three tips for making passwords that reduce security risks: use a password manager, use unique passwords, and use stronger passwords.

### 1. Use a password manager

There's a secret to dealing with passwords: use a password manager to store your passwords. This way, you only need to memorize a few strong passwords: your master password for the password manager, your laptop password and phone passcode, and maybe a few others (such as your iCloud password if that's [your recovery method for forgetting your laptop password](/equipment/#laptop)).

[**1Password**](https://1password.com/) and [**KeePassX**](https://www.keepassx.org/) are password managers approved for work. You can get a license for 1Password by asking [18fsoftware@gsa.gov](mailto:18fsoftware@gsa.gov). KeePassX is free.

You can use iCloud or Dropbox or manual syncing to keep your 1Password or KeePassX synced across multiple work devices (work laptop to work phone, for example), as you're just transferring encrypted information around. Do not store the password in iCloud. iCloud Keychain isn't approved for work-related passwords or other sensitive government information.

You can use your password manager to generate a random unique password for each service you use. In [**1Password**, use these instructions](https://support.1password.com/guides/mac/generate-a-strong-password.html). OS X also has a local password generator: in the **Keychain Access** app, view the suggestions under **File > New Password Item > key icon**.

You can use your password manager to store answers to security questions. Instead of setting up real answers (which could be guessable by somebody with information about you), consider setting up nonsense answers and storing those answers in your password manager.

### 2. Use unique passwords

Here's an interesting comparison of non-expert and expert security practices, from [a study done by Google](http://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.com/2015/07/new-research-comparing-how-security.html):

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/equipment/1.png" alt="secure password tips" />

Note the second point: the experts considered unique passwords even more important than strong/complex passwords. If hackers dump the password database from one service, you don't want them to be able to use that password to access your accounts on other services.

To limit this risk, use new passwords for work services instead of reusing any passwords from your personal life (don't use your Amazon password as your ENT password). Also use a unique password for each service you use (don't use the same password for Slack and ENT).

### 3. Use strong passwords

Even if you use a password manager, you'll still need to memorize a few unique passwords, such as the master password for your password manager.

This opens up a few risks: A person could try to guess your password based on information about you, or a computer program could try to find your password by "brute forcing" it (making a zillion guesses based on common types and patterns of passwords). To limit these risks:

- Use passwords that are hard to guess even for people who know you -- not your birthday, university, pet's name, favorite TV show, or similar.
- Use passwords that probably nobody else uses. For some interesting examples of common passwords, check out [this list](https://web.archive.org/web/20151005001104/http://stricture-group.com/files/adobe-top100.txt) based on a real Adobe account dump; you can see dictionary words, names of favorite people/pets/characters/teams, words related to the service, and simple patterns of numbers and letters.
- Use longer passwords rather than shorter passwords, since that makes "brute forcing" harder.

[This XKCD comic](https://xkcd.com/936/) explains a common password pattern and one strategy for making stronger passwords:

<img src="http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/password_strength.png" alt="password strength comic from XKCD" />

In other words, you could use a series of random words, plus a few numbers, capital letters, or symbols, if you like.

Or try thinking of a sentence or line from a book, song, speech, poem, or other memorable source, then build a many-character password using the first letter of each word, with some capitalization, numbers, and symbols thrown in. Or just use the whole line or sentence as your password! (You'd need to pick a phrase that nobody would guess based on knowing you.)
