⭐ If this is a press request (newspaper, TV station, radio station, podcast, or blog) forward the request to press@gsa.gov. OSC will handle responding, coordinating, and gaining the necessary approvals.

Speaking externally is a privilege, as you are representing GSA and your fellow TTSers. There is an approval process. GSA’s Office of Strategic Communications (OSC) and TTS Outreach must approve your participation, talking points, and presentation materials before you can participate in any external events.

We want you to share your expertise and represent TTS/GSA, and we want the approval process to be as seamless, transparent, and speedy as possible.

Each time you are invited to speak, use this playbook to access updated guidelines. The playbook covers both events and media interviews. Once your request is approved, schedule a run-through with TTS Outreach at tts-outreach@gsa.gov if it’s your first engagement or if you haven’t been on the speaking circuit for awhile.

This process has five major steps and can take up to 3-6 weeks to complete. Here is a breakdown of the 5 major steps.

1. Awareness: Understanding the approval process and timeline
2. Join the TTS Speaker’s Bureau
3. Decide if you should be speaking
4. Prepare for your talk
5. Provide feedback on the event

<Summary> Step 1: Awareness: Understanding the approval process and timeline</summary>

Once you submit a request, you will receive an automated email confirmation. That email will also ping TTS leadership to approve your request, so it can move up the approval chain. TTS Events will move your request through the GSA approval process, gaining approval from

- TTS (your manager, Outreach Director, and Assistance Commissioner(?)),
- Federal Acquisition Services (FAS), and
- Office of Strategic Communications (OSC)

##### APPROVAL TIMELINE

Most approvals will take 2-3 weeks to complete. Requests submitted with less than a week lead time are not likely to be approved--please check in with your designated Outreach/Events lead  before submitting an approval with less than a week lead time. .

- Until you have been fully approved, the event organizers cannot name you in their marketing materials. Let TTS Outreach know if you run into an issue.
- You should not promote your participation until final approval has been given by GSA </details>

<Summary> Step 2: Join the TTS Speaker’s Bureau</summary>

<Summary> Step 3: Decide if you should be speaking</summary>

If you have been formally invited to participate in a speaking engagement, you must answer the following questions.

- Do you have time?
- Does the event fit fully within your realm of expertise?
- Does the event reflect TTS and your team’s larger mission?
- Are you clear how speaking on this topic to this audience in this forum advances of TTS and your team?
- Are you comfortable speaking publicly in a virtual setting?
- Is a colleague better suited to speaking on this topic?
- Are there any sensitivities that may preclude you from speaking publicly?
- Is this event not inclusive or representative of our TTS diversity?
- Will you be speaking in your personal capacity?
- Is this event scheduled for less than 15 days from now?

⭐ If you answer yes to any of the questions above, stop here and contact your direct supervisor or TTS Outreach.

<details> <summary> Step 4: Gather information and submit your request </summary>

- Prepare your talking points. Talking points are required for you to get approval to represent your GSA at a speaking engagement.
- Use the TTS-wide [Talking Points Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vsqMqtcZSSq_IhpFhtUnnNH70hcHGVaWnxhSpe_s054/edit)  to create talking points.
- Have a brief intro prepared for your engagement, along with a few lines about your role at GSA. For guidance, see the above Talking Points Template.
- Once you’ve drafted your talking points, submit them to your direct supervisor. And if you will be speaking about a specific engagement, submit your drafted talking points to the engagement lead.
- Review the TTS Internal/External Virtual Events Guidance and know how to answer Project Specific/TTS/GSA-specific questions, including those outside your direct area of expertise or the topic at hand.
- Consult with SMEs and peers for substantive input and review prior to submitting your Talking Points.
- Complete and submit the TTS Events’ Speaking, Conferences and Training Google form to TTS Events. To fill out this form, you will need:

  - A description of the audience
  - A copy of your event invite \[create a PDF and upload to Google Drive; make it accessible to all of GSA]
  - To know if the press is invited
  - To know if your event/panel will be pre-recorded
  - To explain why your participation is necessary
  - Complete Talking Points </details>

<details> <summary> Step 5: Prepare for your talk </summary>

As your speaking engagement is moving through the approval process, take some time to consider the following topics.

- Until you have been fully approved, the event organizers cannot name you in their marketing materials. Let TTS know if you run into an issue.
- You should not promote your participation until final approval has been given by GSA.
- Your talking points may change after your run-through with the event organizer. If this happens you are responsible for notifying the TTS Outreach Director.

##### Preparation:

- If you are using slides, use this TTS Slide Deck template for your presentation or your Business Unit’s specific template.

  - [TTS Template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_R4EuC9Eiec0DQhSP5PDe5rdMeIijrTt0nhp8jghWaE/edit#slide=id.p)

- Is your presentation accessible? Do you verbally describe the images on your slides?
- How to Make Your Presentations Accessible to All
- How to make Accessible PDF from Google
- Is your presentation engaging?
- Have you planned for the unexpected? Ensure your computer is fully charged
- Determine if you can log in from your phone if an issue arises with your computer
- Be prepared to dial in as opposed to using computer audio if needed
- If you need notes, have a print out or have them pulled up on your phone so they’re easily accessible
- Dress to impress. Certain colors and patterns can create a moire effect which can impact people's perception and ability to digest the video. If possible, avoid stripes or busy patterns and stick with solid colors.
- Be conscious of lighting. For optimal lighting and video quality, presenters want to be lit from the front and not the back, so make sure your light (whether artificial or natural) is adjusted accordingly.  A single light source is ideal.
- GSA’s Logo Policy does not authorize vendors of any kind to use the GSA Star Mark logo. The GSA Advantage, GSA Contract, and GSA Schedule logos are the only logos approved for use by GSA contractors.
- Recording and sharing materials: In general, all material that GSA presents is in the public domain, and government employees can be photographed or recorded doing official activities on official time without permission. As long as the event coordinator is not trying to: retain the rights to the content, put the recording behind a paywall that is not accessible to the public, or use the recording for monetary gain, then you can give them permission to record and post.
