At GSA, [Google Docs/Sheets/Slides]({{site.baseurl}}/google-drive/) is our preferred tool for documents/spreadsheets/presentations, since it has built-in records retention, collaboration, sharing, importing and exporting of Office files, etc. Should you encounter an edge case such as a large spreadsheet that won't load well in Google Sheets, you can use Microsoft Office through [VMWare Horizon]({{site.baseurl}}/vmware-horizon/).
