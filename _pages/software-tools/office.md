At GSA, [Google Docs/Sheets/Slides]({{site.baseurl}}/google-drive/) is our preferred tool for documents/spreadsheets/presentations, since it has built-in records retention, collaboration, sharing, importing and exporting of Office files, etc.

In normal day-to-day operations, you will probably never need Microsoft Office. However, if you should encounter an edge case such as a large spreadsheet that won't load well in Google Sheets, you can use Microsoft Office through [VMWare Horizon]({{site.baseurl}}/vmware-horizon/).

_TTS/GSA used to offer Office for Mac 2016, but given the overhead in installing and managing licenses and being [previously denied by the IT Standards process](https://ea.gsa.gov/#!/itstandards/1032), this was discontinued in November 2019._

If you have any questions, please ask #infrastructure.
