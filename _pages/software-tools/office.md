title: Microsoft Office

At GSA, [Google Docs/Sheets/Slides]({{site.baseurl}}/google-drive/) is our preferred productivity tool. 

Highlight of features that make it the preference:
- built-in records retention
- collaboration
- sharing
- access control features
- importing and exporting of Office files

In normal day-to-day operations, you will probably never need Microsoft Office. Yet, the following scenarios have come up as validated needs for needing a tool outside of the preferred solution: 
- a large spreadsheet that won't load well in Google Sheets


Suggested alternatives:
- you can use Microsoft Office through [Virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI)]({{site.baseurl}}/vmware-horizon/).
- Switching to a PC
  - These have Office 2010 pre-installed
  - If you want to do this, submit a Hardware Request and specify that you are looking to trade in your Mac

_TTS/GSA used to offer Office for Mac 2016, but given the overhead in installing and managing licenses and being [previously denied by the IT Standards process](https://ea.gsa.gov/#!/itstandards/1032), this was discontinued in November 2019._
