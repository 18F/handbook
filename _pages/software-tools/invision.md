[18F Design]({{site.baseurl}}/design/) uses [InVision](https://www.invisionapp.com/) for prototyping and group online critique. Using InVision at GSA comes with one specific rule: we cannot use any cloud-syncing features. Please don't use InVision Cloud or InVision Sync.

If you are a member of the 18F Design team, once you have requested and received an InVision license, tell your supervisor that you have an account and are ready to be added to the "18F Design Team" [group](https://gsa.invisionapp.com/d/main?origin=v7#/company/teams) in InVision. This will enable you to see prototypes from all of our projects. When making your own prototypes in the future, always add this team as a collaborator.

## Offboarding

[Transfer ownership of your prototypes](https://support.invisionapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/203730565-How-do-I-transfer-my-prototype-to-another-account-) to your supervisor or to another project team member so that they won't be lost once your account is deactivated.
