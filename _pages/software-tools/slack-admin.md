This page overviews the administrative tasks done to manage our Slack account at TTS.
– See the [Slack Handbook Page]({{site.baseurl}}/slack/) for an introduction and setup
– See the [Slack @ TTS :lock:](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Hm42cg61S7FPhaLrRIJxl-LXQCcwGvJTKX_wG0Jz4aU/edit#heading=h.ho6etfp5g3pp) internal how-to guide 

## Adding TTS staff

Fill out the [user request form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfYQ-D82rIGwbCmwF3kAQERqczi5syVGq6GtmQNR6fhxRAA2Q/viewform?usp=sf_link).

### Adding external collaborators

We can invite people outside TTS to have access to a **single channel** on our Slack account. These single-channel users are free, and don't need financial authorization from TeamOps or security clearance from TTS Tech Portfolio. These users may include:

- Vendors _under contract_ (not just a Terms of Service) with TTS
- Vendors with GSA who are working on a project with TTS, for which we have an Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)
- Partners at federal agencies whose projects are under an Interagency Agreement with TTS, or at state or local agencies whose projects are under an Intergovernmental Collaboration Act agreement with TTS.
- Federal staff with government email addresses (for example, friends at the USDS, CFPB, other teams inside GSA, etc.).
- Members of the public collaborating on an open source project in a public channel via [chat.18f.gov](https://chat.18f.gov).

TTS reserves the right to bill for partners with access to more than channel your IAA / budget line at [the normal Slack user rate](https://slack.com/pricing). When possible, we prefer to set up shared channels with partners over having multi-channel guests.

You may want to invite partners, contractors, etc. to specific project channels to foster collaboration and asynchronous communication with the team. Most 18F projects [create](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/201402297-Creating-a-channel) specific channels that end with `-partners`.

1. [Create a `<project>-partners` channel](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/201402297-Creating-a-channel), if you don't want them in an existing channel.
1. Fill out the [user request form](https://docs.google.com/a/gsa.gov/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfYQ-D82rIGwbCmwF3kAQERqczi5syVGq6GtmQNR6fhxRAA2Q/viewform).

A small number of close TTS collaborators at GSA may be full Slack members at the discretion of the head of infrastructure. Examples might include the Chief Information Officer or FAS Commissioner. Ask in [#admins-slack](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/messages/admins-slack) if you'd like to add someone to this category.

## Shared channels

Slack offers a feature to create [shared channels with other workspaces](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/115004151203-Create-shared-channels-on-a-workspace-beta-). Shared channels are a more efficient and economic way to work with people in other Slack workspaces than managing them in our Slack workspace as guests, especially when using multiple channels for a project. All records in shared channels are [retained and available for Corporate Exports](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/204897248-Guide-to-Slack-import-and-export-tools).

### Requesting a new shared channel
When you are interested in a shared channel, please drop into [#admins-slack](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/messages/C02KW46DP) to request it. Please specify if you want to use a new channel or want us to share an existing channel. Please also give us a heads up before partners send us a sharing request.

### Guidance for using shared channels
When participating in shared channels, please keep in mind:

* While people in similar organizations share areas of focus, we should treat our collaborators in these channels as **members of the public** and only share information we would put into public channels. Anything said in those channels is a public announcement and could end up posted on twitter by someone else, for example. This does not apply to shared channels with an active agreement between us and the people in the other workspace.

* Nothing about a shared Slack channel itself implies a partnership between TTS and the other organization. The shared channel just adds another possible route of communication to e-mail, twitter, listserves, and so on. Do not feel obligated to answer a DM from someone in a shared channel.

* We should not mention the Slack orgs of our partners in public channels or to other agencies without permission. It's not for us as TTS to share which other groups in gov are using Slack, nor do we want to appear to be endorsing its use for others.

* For all shared and public channels, it's not a good idea to invite people into a shared channel that aren't there. Instead, DM them the link to an interesting message. Pulling them in without their consent (where others can @ or DM them) may not be fair to their schedule if they need to be heads down.

Likewise, when setting up shared channels, we will look to set these expectations with workspaces with which we connect:

* Members of our team in shared channels may not have a lot of time to respond to DMs from partner orgs. Requests for documents, materials, and etc are better placed in the open channel for anyone to see and triage.

* Members of our team will only want to share materials that are already public. If you have a specific request for a private document, that request is better e-mailed than put into Slack, as that e-mail will have to be sent around to various GSA offices to ensure compliance.

* Anyone in a shared channel must also comply with GSA standards and the [TTS Code of Conduct]({{site.baseurl}}/code-of-conduct).

If a shared channel does not produce good results, or causes a burden, we don't need to continue it. That won't be the end of our collaboration - just recognizing that a particular tool isn't effective for achieving the results that we want. If the shared channel is with a private entity (contractor or vendor) we will not continue sharing a channel after the agreement covering our work elapses.

## Public channels

[TTS](http://www.gsa.gov/portal/category/25729) has specific channels in Slack that are open to the public to join. These channels end with `-public`. (Note: In Slack's parlance, all channels in a workspace are either `public`, allowing any full member to find/join, or `private`. However, when we say "public channels" on this page, we mean channels open to all members of the public.)

Friends with `.gov`/`.mil` email addresses who aren't collaborating on a project can be invited into public channels. Fill out the [user request form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfYQ-D82rIGwbCmwF3kAQERqczi5syVGq6GtmQNR6fhxRAA2Q/viewform?usp=sf_link).

Treat these public channels like you would a livestreamed event on GSA's YouTube page or other type of public meeting open to guests. Materials and documents should not be shared only in public channels; instead, they should be published on TTS websites and then linked to from the public channels so that access to Slack isn't required to see the document. 

Members of the public must also comply with GSA standards and the [TTS Code of Conduct]({{site.baseurl}}/code-of-conduct). 

For all shared and public channels, it's not a good idea to invite people into a shared channel that aren't there without a heads up. Instead, please DM them the link to an interesting message. Pulling them in without their consent (where others can @ or DM them) may not be fair to their schedule if they need to be heads down.

To invite people to a public Slack channel, send them to [chat.18f.gov](https://chat.18f.gov/) and have them select the appropriate channel from the drop-down. Note that these users are added as [**single-channel** guests](https://slack.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/201314026-Understanding-roles-permissions-inside-Slack).

#### Add a new public channel

See [the instructions](https://github.com/18F/chat#adding-new-public-channels).

## Offboarding

Slack users need to be offboarded in the following situations:

* Someone leaving TTS
    * Someone from [#talent](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/messages/talent/) should fill out [the user modification form](https://docs.google.com/a/gsa.gov/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfYQ-D82rIGwbCmwF3kAQERqczi5syVGq6GtmQNR6fhxRAA2Q/viewform) when this happens.
* A partner who's employment/engagement is ending
    * It is the responsibility of the engagement manager to inform @slackadmin in [#admins-slack](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/messages/admins-slack/) when this is happening.
* A contractor who is no longer supporting TTS
    * The COR or the TTS representative that added the contractor to Slack should fill out [the user modification form](https://docs.google.com/a/gsa.gov/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfYQ-D82rIGwbCmwF3kAQERqczi5syVGq6GtmQNR6fhxRAA2Q/viewform) when the period of performance ends.

An admin will then do one of the following:

* **[Convert them to a Single-Channel Guest.](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/218124397-Change-a-team-member-s-role)**
    * Put them in one of the following channels (as appropriate):
        * [#alumni](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/messages/alumni/) (former Full Members only, but treated as a public channel)
        * One of the `-public` channels (their pick)
    * [Disable their 2FA](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/212221668-Require-two-factor-authentication-for-your-team).
        * ...unless you know they were using their personal device for 2FA — we don't want them to be locked out.
    * [Change their email](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/225531168-Change-a-team-member-s-email-address) to their personal address

*NOTE: When a TTS Slack user is converted to a Single-channel user, they maintain access to their direct message chat history but are unable to search for or create new direct messages with folks that they've never messaged before.  Unless another channel is specified, the only channel that will still be accessible is #alumni.

* **[Deactivate their account.](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/204475027-Deactivate-a-team-member-s-account)**

If they were a partner, the admin will also set their `Downgraded/disabled on` date in [the user request spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1weEbuD1RUqtwTiHCT_roD6tvKkBiQL5nkLe8btxyKHA/edit#gid=1249016991).

## Slack admins

Here are the resources used by Slack Admins to track and manage Slack accounts:

* [GSA IT's Slack administration guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ncHqriv2CnsZQ7brrZ3mlLCK_i-XuvW-kRpXb0fP0t4/edit)
* Subscribe to responses for the following forms ([screen capture](https://cl.ly/03100Y0u2v2i))
  * [New user requests (internal)](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfYQ-D82rIGwbCmwF3kAQERqczi5syVGq6GtmQNR6fhxRAA2Q/viewform?usp=sf_link)
  * [New public user requests (external)](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfYQ-D82rIGwbCmwF3kAQERqczi5syVGq6GtmQNR6fhxRAA2Q/viewform?usp=sf_link)
  * [Integration requests](https://docs.google.com/a/gsa.gov/forms/d/1sH-eLcDMDSBE9xvUnbE39N0PFOcfg6Mf3mnWU8xzBz8/edit#responses)
* [Delegation of functionality](https://docs.google.com/a/gsa.gov/document/d/1gDuScce7R6q6NqQPPS3cFe3dZFYO_ZEp60dmuzVDYwg/edit?usp=sharing)

## Records policy

Per the mandatory [General Records Schedule 3.1](http://www.archives.gov/records-mgmt/memos/ac33-2014.html) issued by the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), everything in Slack channels and groups is considered at minimum a temporary record.

To ensure compliance with the possibility that we might create permanent or long-lived records in Slack, the records retention policy is set to **retain all messages forever AND also retain edit and deletion logs for all messages**. Users are prohibited from deleting messages. Do not abuse the `edit` command in Slack to effectively delete your message by replacing it with null or symbolic content. Edits for clarity or typos are fine. If any bot or integration ever posts something inappropriate, please call for a clean-up in [#admins-slack](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/messages/admins-slack/) using `@slackadmin`.

This policy applies to all types of Slack communications: public channels, private groups, even direct messages. **Nothing is private.** We use the [Corporate Export](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/204897248-Guide-to-Slack-import-and-export-tools) capability in Slack to get the data and filter using the [slack-export-handling](https://github.com/18F/slack-export-handling) tool.

During regular operations, only the Slack Owners have access to the exports. There is no regular monitoring of these messages, but they have been reviewed in the past. Various legal actions (for example, a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request) or security operations approved by the TTS Tech Portfolio Director have required others to view the exports. The team will continue to be notified at the earliest possible time that the exports have been accessed. Notifications of access may not be made in realtime.

## Exporting channel contents

There is not an easy way to export the contents of a single channel, for partners or otherwise. If you really want, you can:

1. Open the Slack channel in Chrome
1. [Take a screenshot](https://zapier.com/blog/full-page-screenshots-in-chrome/)
1. Scroll up
1. Repeat

These, of course, will be images, so they unfortunately won't be searchable.
