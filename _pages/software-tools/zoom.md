Zoom is a video-conferencing tool used by TTS for large meetings.
We recommend it for video calls with over twenty participants. Use of the native Zoom app is
usually much lighter on machine resources (especially the CPU) than Google Hangouts.

Zoom lives on the web at [https://zoom.us](https://zoom.us/)

## Setup

If you've been invited to a Zoom meeting, you've likely been given a `zoom.us` URL. Clicking
that URL will take you to a page that lets you join the meeting using your web browser or to
download the Zoom client app for your computer. We generally recommend installing the native
client if you have time, as it's often smoother and faster to use than the web client.

To install the client natively on your Mac, [download it](https://zoom.us/client/latest/zoomusInstaller.pkg)
and double click the `.pkg` file. Accept the defaults and click next until it completes the install.
It will open the app following installation, where you can set your defaults.

## How to create a Zoom account

1. Go into the [#admins-zoom](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/messages/admins-zoom) channel
1. Ask for an invite: "Zoom invite please! My GSA email address is `YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS`."
1. One of the admins will [add you](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201363183-User-Management#h_8b193526-997c-4385-955b-ffddda0b0404)
1. Click on the link in your email to accept the invitation, and set up your access either via Google Auth (recommended) or by creating a separate password.

Alternatively, you can [create your own account](https://zoom.us/signup). However, if you
think that you will ever need to host a meeting longer than 40 minutes, you should just request
an invitation so that you belong to the TTS organization. If you already have an account, you
can still be added to the TTS organization in the future.

Once you have created your account, consider adding a profile picture and your location and pronouns to your display name.

### For meetings longer than 40 minutes

Let [#admins-zoom](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/messages/admins-zoom) know as far in advance as possible. They can upgrade you to be a [Licensed user](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201363173-Account-Types#usertype).

### For meetings with over 100 participants

We have one large meeting extension for meetings with over 100 participants. Let [#admins-zoom](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/messages/admins-zoom) know when you need it (including time zone) and they can [assign it to you](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362823-What-is-a-Large-Meeting-#h_f5e58bf2-4817-4a63-b44c-ca4f6be9229d). If there are multiple meetings scheduled that day, your account will be promoted as soon as the Pro account is available.

### Frequently Asked Questions

Q: If I am hosting a Free meeting and it looks like it will go long, can you promote me to a Licensed user?

A: No. Once your meeting has started, it will not convert to a Licensed user without restarting the meeting.

Q: I don't need moderation and want to host a longer meeting. Is there a link that I can just use?

A: No. If you are scheduling a meeting, you need to use your Zoom link or a link from the "My Meetings" tab. You do not need to be present in the meeting for participants to join, unless you have the meeting settings set to have the host sign in before the meeting can start.

Q: How much advance notice do you need for a longer meeting?

A: As much as possible. If there is no one on the calendar, and a Zoom Admin is available, your account could be converted quickly. But please ask in advance whenever possible.

Q: How do I enable Breakout rooms?

A: See [the Zoom documentation](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/206476093-Getting-Started-with-Breakout-Rooms).
