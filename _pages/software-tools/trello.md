[Trello](https://trello.com/) is a collaborative task and project-management tool. TTS has a number of [Workspaces](https://help.trello.com/article/927-what-are-teams) under the `GSA IT - IDT` Enterprise account.

## Usage

People use Trello to track ideas from conception through execution. It's common to see a working group using Trello to collaborate in creating documentation. Sometimes we track business development leads on a Trello board. Some individuals use Trello to help track and prioritize their own queue of work. Most commonly, Trello is used by TTS teams applying agile processes like Scrum and Kanban to deliver software.

## Rules

- Use your `@gsa.gov` email to sign in, if you have one.
  - Signing in via Google is recommended.
- **Abide by [the TTS Code of Conduct]({{site.baseurl}}/code-of-conduct).** If you see anyone violating our Code of Conduct, see the reporting section.
- Only use [approved Power-Ups](#power-ups)
- Create boards under GSA-managed Workspaces, not under your individual account

## Setup

- To get added to an existing board, ask your team (at least one of whom should be a [Board Admin](https://help.trello.com/article/791-changing-permissions-on-a-board)) to add you. They will add you as a [Board Guest](https://help.trello.com/article/1236-board-guests).
  - Same goes for adding partners.
- To have a new board created, ask in #admins-trello.

## Tips

- Check out Trello's [extensive keyboard shortcuts](https://trello.com/shortcuts). Trello has a notion of a "card focus" attached to your mouse, so you can just point at a card to highlight it, then press a single key (not button) to interact with it in common ways. It's like you have a hundred-button mouse! Definitely check out (`E`)dit description, edit (`T`)itle, (`N`)ew card next, ar(`C`)hive, (`L`)abel, (`M`)embers, and the most critical of all, `space` (to quickly toggle yourself in or out of the card member list).

- [Set a board background](https://help.trello.com/article/818-changing-board-backgrounds) to easily distinguish that board in bookmark favicons, when flipping tabs, and generally make people happier.

- Use [stickers](https://help.trello.com/article/826-adding-and-removing-stickers-from-cards) to indicate cards that are blocked (exclamation point), need clarification (uncertain orange face), waiting for something (clock), represent a milestone/launch being reached (rocket).

- Doing prioritization within a labeled set of cards (an epic)? Use the filter (keyboard shortcut `F`) to show just that label, then sort cards, then turn the filter back off.

- Looking for feedback on card priority? [Turn on the card-voting power-up](https://help.trello.com/article/788-voting-on-cards) and set the voting permissions appropriately (eg to allow non-members to vote on a public-facing roadmap board). Note that there's no easy way to clear votes, so only use this for collecting long-lived data, eg votes on items in your backlog. Also sadly, there's no way to sort by votes; you have to do that by hand.

- Want to create a bunch of similar cards easily? [Make one "template" card](https://help.trello.com/article/1211-creating-template-cards) and label it clearly. When you want to make a new one, copy that card to the appropriate location. Want to do it quickly? See the "Shortcuts for Trello" Chrome extensions tip below.

If you get a `Manually Banned Apps Policy` email from [Cloudlock](https://insite.gsa.gov/employee-resources/information-technology/do-it-yourself-self-help/google-g-suite-apps/sharing-securely-in-google/cloudlock), it's likely because you signed into Trello with Google (via OAuth), and one of the Trello Teams you're part of has the [Google Drive Power-Up](https://trello.com/power-ups/55a5d916446f517774210006) enabled. That Power-Up should be removed, but this warning can otherwise be ignored.
