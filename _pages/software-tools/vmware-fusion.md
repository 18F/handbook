title: VMware Fusion
---

VMware Fusion is a software hypervisor developed by VMware for Macintosh
computers for running virtual machines. VMware Fusion allows Intel-based Macs to
run operating systems such as Microsoft Windows, Linux, NetWare, or Solaris on
virtual machines, along with their macOS operating system. We use VMware Fusion
to aid in software development on various platforms.

     installed through the GSA Self Service application.
