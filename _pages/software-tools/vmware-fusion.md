title: VMware Fusion
---

VMware Fusion is a software hypervisor developed by VMware for Macintosh
computers for running virtual machines. VMware Fusion allows Intel-based Macs to
run operating systems such as Microsoft Windows, Linux, NetWare, or Solaris on
virtual machines, along with their macOS operating system. We use VMware Fusion
to aid in software development on various platforms.

## Setup

Installing VMware Fusion is done through GSA Self Service but you need to first
request it through Service Now.

1. [Start a new Software request through the GSA IT Help Desk.](https://gsa.servicenowservices.com/sp/?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=1bfdfdca78d3a400ce3ddff91a64940b)
1. Complete the required fields. For software name, select "VMWare Fusion 10.x Pro: Exception".
1. In the "additional comments" field, specify that you would like it installed through the GSA Self Service application.
1. Click **Add to Cart**.
1. Click **Checkout**.

GSA IT will contact you within a few days. Then VMware Fusion should be
available through the GSA Self Service application.

Note that currently only VMware Fusion 10.x is available which is not optimized
for MacOS Mojave (10.14).
