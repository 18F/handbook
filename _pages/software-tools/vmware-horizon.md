Citrix VDI is a Windows virtual desktop client that can be used to connect to GSAâ€™s intranet, or test something in Internet Explorer.


## Usage


See [the InSite page](https://insite.gsa.gov/employee-resources/information-technology/do-it-yourself-self-help/telework-technology/virtual-desktop/citrix-vdi/logon-using-the-citrix-client). Note that you may need to follow the "Personal Mac" instructions.

## Software

Citrix VDI is the easiest way to use software that's available for Windows but not Mac. If the software you need isn't already pre-installed, you can request installation by [opening a Software request with the GSA IT Service Desk](https://gsa.service-now.com/sp/?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=1bfdfdca78d3a400ce3ddff91a64940b). Make sure to note that you are requesting installation in VDI, not your laptop.

## Tips

- To move files between your laptop and your Horizon desktop, use Google Drive. You can use Chrome in the Horizon desktop to download and upload files.
