title: How to say no
---

Here are a few ways to kindly and firmly say no when you need to focus.

##  Redirect to your supervisor

“I’ve got to focus on this, and if you check with {supervisor’s name} and if {they’re} cool with it, I’m happy to help!”

## Just say no

“No, I can’t do that.”

## Ask them to prioritize

“Here’s a list of things I’m working on: {Trello or ZenHub link}. Can you help me prioritize your request?”

## See if you’re an optional attendee

“Is this a critical meeting, or can I catch up on the notes afterwards?”

## Defer until later

“I want to be in that meeting so I can be aware of the kinds of decisions we’re making, but I won’t be able to work on this until after I finish {my project work}.”

“Do you need a decision on this now, or does it fit with the schedule to wait for me to finish {my project work} so that I can dig into this topic and give you better input?”

“I would genuinely like to contribute, but I need to focus on my billable project right now. Can we add this to the backlog?”

“I can’t take that on right now, but let’s schedule a meeting {next week} to pick this up when I have more bandwidth.”

“Sure. How’s {date months in the future} for a start date on that?”

## Dig into the deadline

“Can you tell me more about the urgency of this request? I’m juggling project work right now, but I have more time next week.”

## Offer a specific limited thing instead

“I have to focus on my {project work}, so I can’t join this, but I can find half an hour to chat over your ideas with you. Let’s find a time next week.”

## Acknowledge the project’s value

And _then_ defer: “That sounds like a really amazing project! Sadly, right now I don’t have the {time/focus/brain-space} to contribute."

“Thanks so much for thinking of me! I think this is important work, but I’m in a crunch time with my project, and don’t have the time to make this work within this timeline. If I can help in a smaller way (like proofing or a short chat), I’d be happy to!”

## Recommend someone else

“You know who’s great at this? {Name}.”

## Slow things down with strategic questions

“Before we start working on that, can we talk about your larger goals for the project?”

## Offer alternatives

“I’m not going to do that right now, because I don’t think that’s the right thing to do. Here are some alternative suggestions: {link to guidance or include things to think about}.”

## Gather some data for yourself

“I have 32 hours for this project, 4 hours of meetings, and 20 free minutes. I just can’t do this right now.”

## Give yourself permission to focus

For yourself: “Choosing one thing to do for the next half hour doesn’t mean I won’t ever do the other things — the stakes aren’t very high if I do the wrong thing for half an hour.”
