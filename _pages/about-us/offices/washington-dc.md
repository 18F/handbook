## Getting here

### From the airport

**Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA)** is the closest airport to D.C. (and GSA). If you&rsquo;re coming from DCA, you can take a cab (~$20) or ride the Metro, which is likely faster. Take the Blue line from the Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport station to Farragut West station. It should take approximately 15 minutes and cost ~$2.15. Once outside the Metro station, follow the directions under "Public Transit."

If you&rsquo;re coming from **Dulles International Airport (IAD)**, you can take a cab (~$80) or ride public transit, which will take about an hour and cost between $7.00 and $8.25. You can take the 5A bus from Dulles Main Terminal to the Rosslyn station on the Blue/Orange/Silver Line. You can then hop on a Metro to the Farragut West station. More information is available on the Metro site. Once outside the station, follow the directions under "Public Transit."

If you&rsquo;re coming from **Thurgood Marshall Baltimore-Washington Airport (BWI)**, you can:
- Take a cab (~$100)
- Ride a MARC train ($7) to Union Station. MARC trains have a limited weekend schedule, but tickets are valid for a full calendar day— use your ticket to board any departing MARC train. From Union Station, take the Red line to Farragut North station.
- Ride an Amtrak train to Union Station (~$15). Your ticket is for a specified time and train, which can be problematic if your flight is delayed. From Union Station, take the Red line to Farragut North station.
- Take the B30 express Metro bus ($7) to Greenbelt station on the Green Line. Take the Green Line to either Fort Totten or Gallery Place, and transfer to the Red Line. Take the Red Line to Farragut North.

### Walking

18F&rsquo;s Washington office is located two blocks from the White House, six blocks from the Farragut North station, and three blocks from the Farragut West Metro Station. If you&rsquo;d like to take an afternoon walk, the Smithsonian is three blocks away via 18th Street.


### Biking

Bike parking is free. The entrance to the bike room is via a ramp on E Street by Greenberry&rsquo;s Coffee. (There are two ramps into the 18F office. The one closer to 19th Street is the one you&rsquo;re looking for.) You must show your GSA ID to the guide and then take your bike down to the bike room in the big building at the center of the courtyard.

There are also numerous Capital Bikeshare stations in the vicinity.


### Public transit

Take the Metro Red Line to Farragut North, or take the Metro Orange/Blue Line to Farragut West. Exit the Metro on the 18th Street side and walk south on 18th Street about four blocks to F Street. The entrance to GSA is located at the middle of the building on F Street, between 18th and 19th Street.

### Parking

There are two parking garages near GSA on 18th Street, one on the right and one on the left just as you pass F Street, between F and G Streets. In addition, there are other parking garages on Pennsylvania Avenue, between 18th and 17th Street within walking distance of GSA.

Parking at nearby garages tends to cost ~$14 for the first hour and then ~$21 for the second hour to a full day.

### Once inside GSA

When entering from the F Street entrance, continue straight past security down the hallway in front of you. At the end of the hallway, take the elevators up to floor four. Once out of the elevators, take two quick right turns and you&rsquo;ll be in the fourth floor infill. A map is here.


## How do I&hellip;


### Enter the building for the first time?

Enter through the main building entrance on F Street, tell the security guard you&rsquo;re here and provide them with a photo ID. (Note that pocket knives with blades longer than 2½" are prohibited.) Later on in the day (or soon after) you will have the opportunity to pick up your official GSA ID Badge.


### Enter the building if I&rsquo;m based in another office?

Your badge should get you in. If you&rsquo;re having trouble, call one of the points of contact listed above, or ask in [#dc](https://18f.slack.com/messages/dc/).


### Get my fingerprints and badge?

Fingerprinting and the photo for your badge take place immediately after security in room 1033. Badge pickup is on the first floor, in the library. After pickup, you'll need to get it activated in the basement.

### Attend GSA and 18F orientation

The location of onboarding differs based on how many people are coming into GSA. You will find out the exact location once you arrive at orientation.

### Mail something to the office?

Send mail to:
> General Services Administration | 1800 F ST NW | Rm 4400 | Washington, DC 20405-0001 (you can add "ATTN: Name" at top).

### Access the building after hours?

Go to the F Street entrance, where 24/7 access is available.

### Book rooms for meetings?

Depending on your needs, you might need different room accommodations. A cheat sheet for 18F conference rooms lives here. Avoid booking rooms 1470 and up on the first floor, as well as x3xx rooms &mdash; they&rsquo;re really far away from 18F and aren&rsquo;t easily accessible.

### Receive visitors?

If you're expecting a small group of US citizens (fewer than 15 or so), no advance action is required on your part. Let your guest(s) know to bring ID; they'll give your name and the 18F room number (4400) at the security desk. You'll have to go down and escort them up.

If you're expecting a large group, or if the group includes non-US citizens, you should give security advance notice.

### Access a printer?

Refer to [our printer information document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ikw7kfeY10lnImZHN7zq5wNjaTRBdTPkZj4QG7-z3d0/edit#) for more details.

### Get on the wireless?

The guest wireless network in the building is GSA Guest. The password changes monthly. To obtain the current password, type &ldquo;GSA Wireless&rdquo; into any room on Slack and the current password will pop up.

Non-guest wireless access is available using gsa-wireless and authenticating using your ENT username and password.


## Where are the&hellip;

There are maps of the D.C. office in every elevator lobby.


### Bathrooms

Bathrooms are located at the end of both the 4100 and 4200 wings. Additional bathrooms are just outside the 4400 space in the 4100 wing.

### Mother’s rooms

Look for room 1232A at the back of the health center on the first floor. You don’t need to reserve it. If it’s in use, you can use the doctor’s office or one of the other rooms near the health clinic. After 4 p.m., you can access the mother’s room directly from the hallway, but the rest of the health center will be closed.

There is a fridge inside the mother’s room and one outside the room as well. At the end of the day, if there’s any milk in the outer fridge, they’ll move it to the inner fridge.

### Batteries

If you need batteries for your keyboard or trackpad, there is a consolidated supply closet on the first floor of the building, in the 200 wing. There are also rechargeable batteries in a charger plugged into one of the columns in the 4462 area.


### Lockers

The lockers are in two spots. One set is by the couches the other by that large table on the E Street side. You will be assigned a locker if you work in D.C. so that you have a spot for personal belongings.


### Snacks

GSA has a small canteen on the first floor for snacks, yogurts, and coffee. Additionally, there are a series of three drawers for snack foods located within 18F infill that are stocked with snacks purchased with a collective private fund and available for members only. Ask in [#dc](https://18f.slack.com/messages/dc/) if you want to contribute and join.

The DC fridge is cleaned out monthly on Fridays (dates are posted on the fridge), and all food (including containers) is thrown out.


### Spare keyboards and mice

There are several of these located in one of the Gold Key drawers. Batteries can be found in one of the chargers nearby. Note that these will require you to setup bluetooth pairing to your laptop to use them and they may be paired with someone else&rsquo;s machine at first.


### Tissues

There is another fund for purchasing boxes of tissues in the winter months. Ask in [#dc](https://18f.slack.com/messages/dc/) if you want to contribute.


### Water

The water cooler in the infill is reserved for those who have contributed to the water cooler fund. Contact information for joining is on the cooler itself. Please remember to bring your own cup. In addition, there are water fountains by the bathrooms.


## Amenities


### Child care

Here are some [local child care facilities](http://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/101942#DC).


### Gym, lockers, locker rooms

The gym is located in the basement. Make sure you bring your badge with you, as you&rsquo;ll need it to get back into the second wing. The easiest way to get there is by taking the old elevators at the F Street entrance down to the basement, walking slightly north, and then cutting across the parking lot (where the bike room entrance is) into the third wing hallway. The gym is on your left when you walk in, and the men&rsquo;s and women&rsquo;s locker rooms are down the long hallway to your right. If you want a locker, you can reach out to Tenant Support to reserve one by [emailing Tenant Support](mailto:1800Ftenantsupport@gsa.gov).


### Rooftop

Take the elevator to seventh floor for wireless and a beautiful view of the National Mall. The Northeast corner of the building does not have as fine a view, but it does have an overhead awning that better prevents glare on your laptop screen.


### Transit subsidy

All GSA employees are eligible for transit subsidies, which cover the cost of your mass transportation travel to/from work. To receive a transit subsidy for MARC, VRE, and Commuter Buses, fill out [GSA form 3675](https://insite.gsa.gov/graphics/cpo/gsa3675_022009.pdf). The form asks for your supervisor&rsquo;s signature. For Metro, you need [GSA form 3675A](https://insite.gsa.gov/graphics/cpo/gsa3675A022009.pdf) (it will have a &ldquo;SmarTrip Card Serial Number&rdquo; field in the upper right). You must already have a SmarTrip card and have registered it on the Metro website. It should be a distinct card from what you use for personal travel.

After you've obtained your supervisor&rsquo;s signature, send the completed form to [co-transit-subsidy@gsa.gov](mailto:co-transit-subsidy@gsa.gov) for processing. It can take a while to for the subsidy to appear on your card, so do this ASAP.
