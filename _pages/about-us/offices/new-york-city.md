## How do I...

### Visit as a guest?

See the [TTS at WTC](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bqTlkaxRfbPdf0HlYI3TZkwIT9vd2HcN-nh6rTrkJzE/edit#heading=h.gno5incmiuxa) guide.

### Get building access?

See the [TTS at WTC](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bqTlkaxRfbPdf0HlYI3TZkwIT9vd2HcN-nh6rTrkJzE/edit) guide.

### Get my fingerprints and badge?

[Set up an appointment](https://app3.timetrade.com/tc/login.do?url=usaccess) to visit room 200 of [26 Federal Plaza](https://goo.gl/maps/PX99MsBHdnD2).

### Access the building after hours?

Building hours are 6am - 7pm. While you can stay in the space later, you won't be able to get back in if you go to the bathroom or something.

### Book rooms for meetings?

Use [BookIT](http://bookit.gsa.gov/).

### Use the monitors/docks?

[The DisplayLink docks](https://www.targus.com/us/universal-usb-3-0-dv4k-docking-station-with-power-dock177usz) can be used with Macs over USB, though you may need to [install drivers](http://www.displaylink.com/downloads/macos). If that doesn't work, we have a couple of DVI to HDMI cords sitting by the 18F desks that can connect to the monitors directly.

### Use the printers?

Refer to [our printer information document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ikw7kfeY10lnImZHN7zq5wNjaTRBdTPkZj4QG7-z3d0/edit#) for more details.

### Get on the wireless?

The wifi network for GSA staff is `gsa-wireless` - use your ENT credentials. Guests can use `GSA-Guest` - type `guest wifi` in Slack to get the password, which rotates regularly.

## Where are the...

### Bathrooms

In the center "core" of each floor. You will need your badge to get back.

### Mother’s rooms

To be determined.

### Snacks and drinks

There is [a coffee shop on the 64th floor](http://forfivecoffee.com/), and a [cafeteria and another coffee shop on the 35th floor](https://racafes.compass-usa.com/CondeWTC/Pages/Home.aspx?lid=b2). You need to go back down to the 1st floor to go back up to them. There are also many options in [the Oculus mall](https://www.westfield.com/westfieldworldtradecenter/entertainment/dining), or across the street at [Brookfield Place](https://brookfieldplaceny.com/directory/food/all).

### Spare keyboards and mice

There are supply rooms with pens, sticky notes, etc. If you need something ordered, see the [purchase requests](../purchase-requests/#office-supplies) page.

## Transit subsidy

See the [Transit Benefit]({{site.baseurl}}/transit-benefit) page for information on enrollment and deactivation.  This [page on InSite](https://insite.gsa.gov/portal/content/500219) has additional information.

### Use your card

Although it is technically a debit card, when you put the card in an MTA machine, select `Credit Card` as your payment method, and use the same office ZIP code. The balance resets on the 10th of every month. The new balance is intended to cover the following month&rsquo;s transit, but you can use it at any time.

## NYC events

We have a team breakfast every Tuesday morning (BYOB - bring your own breakfast) and a happy hour outing the first Thursday of every month. Both are optional, but lots of fun. Ask to be added to the invite in #nyc.

There is also a shared calendar. If it doesn't show up in Google Calendar already, try adding `gsa.gov_envrspjqmjn4id95uc2fq3l45s@group.calendar.google.com` under "Other calendars".

## Who works here?

You can find everyone who works in the [#nyc](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/messages/nyc/) channel in Slack.
