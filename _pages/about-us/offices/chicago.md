## <a id="getting-here"></a>Getting here

### <a id="from-ohare"></a>From O'Hare International Airport

Public transit is from O'Hare to the TTS Chicago office is cheap, fairly quick, and convenient. Blue Line trains run from the airport to downtown 24/7 and take about 50 minutes. The closest stop to the office is **Jackson**.

### <a id="from-midway"></a>From Midway Airport

The smaller of the two Chicago airports, this one is a little closer to downtown-- it's only a 25 minute ride down the CTA Orange Line. The **Library/State & Van Buren** stops are the closest to the TTS office on your way in, though we recommend getting on at **Adams/Wabash** on your way out (unless you want to get a tour of the entire Chicago loop). While the Orange Line doesn't run 24/7 like the Blue, it does have regular service between 4:30 a.m. and 1 a.m., covering pretty much any reasonable flight departure/arrival times.

### <a id="walking"></a>Walking

Chicago is a very walkable city; plenty of hotels, coffee shops, restaurants, and bars are within walking distance of the office. Grant Park and the lakefront (including the lakefront path) are all close by.

### <a id="biking"></a>Biking

Short-term bikes can be rented via [Divvy](https://www.divvybikes.com/). $15 buys a 24-hour pass with unlimited 3-hour rides. Remember to bring your own helmet when using Divvy!

### <a id="public-transit"></a>Public transit

Chicago is extremely accessible by public transportation. Taxis are available but aren't generally necessary for getting around.

To take full advantage of Chicago's CTA trains and buses, we recommend getting a [Ventra card](https://www.ventrachicago.com/), available at any CTA train station. Ventra cards require a $5 deposit, which is refundable after registering, and the card stays valid for 5 years.

Fares from (but not to) either airport cost $5. All other normal fares are $2.25, and include one transfer to another CTA bus or train for $0.25 plus one free additional transfer if made within two hours of boarding.

### <a id="parking"></a>Parking

Garage parking downtown is very expensive. "Early bird" rates start at $18, and normal rates start at $30. Street parking is hard to come by. See above recommendations on public transit.

### <a id="enter-the-building"></a>Enter the building for the first time (or if I don't have a GSA badge)?

### <a id="onboarding"></a>Attend onboarding?

GSA onboarding is typically done on alternating Mondays at 1:00 p.m. in Room 3722, in the NW corner of the 37th floor. TTS onboarding varies by division-- you should receive an email confirming the times that you will meet with your team. To allow yourself enough time to get set up on the GSA network, please arrive at 8 a.m. on the second day of your first week, and Ethan Heppner (TTS Chicago's office operations coordinator) will help walk you through.

In Chicago, you can book rooms using [BookIt](https://bookit.gsa.gov/mobile/menuAction.do?pageForward=home).

If the room that you want isn't coming up, that means it's probably been booked already. Feel free to [ping Ethan]() if you have any difficulties.
