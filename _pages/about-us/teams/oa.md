Welcome to TTS Office of Acquisition (OA) team page!

## Our Mission

We seek to design and evangelize acquisition approaches that are better aligned with current industry best practices to ensure 
the successful delivery of technology products and services that truly meet the needs of TTS, our agency partners, and the 
people they serve. 

## Our Approach

In pursuit of our mission, we incorporate the following practices:

* Applying agile and human-centered practices to help government buy better technology
* Reducing time and costs
* Starting small and iterating
* Creating cross-functional teams
* Focusing on the user need
* Working in the open and being transparent
* Following the appropriate federal and agency-specific rules and regulations

## What We Do

We buy digital products and services for TTS as well as for partner agencies (coming soon through assisted acquisitions).

### TTS Internal Procurement

[Purchase Requests]({{site.baseurl}}/purchase-requests) section in the handbook. For SaaS purchases under $10,000 please visit the

## TTS OA Operational Guidance

TTS OA aims to redefine the culture of government acquisition of information technology by bringing agile practices to service
level procurement policies. [TTS OA Operational Guidance](https://handbook.18f.gov/acquisition/), which includes standard 
operating procedures, #readme’s, templates, checklists and other operational guidance documents, were established to keep TTS
procurement practices agile, current, applicable and in compliance at the Federal, Agency and Service levels.
