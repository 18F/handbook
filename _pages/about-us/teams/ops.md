_Team Ops (Operations) handles all activities related to travel, non-travel purchases, legal matters, and equipment requests._

Because 18F is a distributed team, it’s likely there’s some **travel** in your future. We’re here to help, and the best place to start is in [#travel](https://18f.slack.com/messages/travel), where [Victor Valdiviezo](https://18f.slack.com/messages/@vv) and [Ethan Heppner](https://18f.slack.com/messages/@eth) can help you vanquish the government travel monster (including getting a GSA-issued travel credit card to get reimbursed for expenses).

Ops is also your go-to place for all **non-travel purchases:** from a $0.99 app to a complex multi-million dollar services contract (though we tend to prefer the $0.99 app variety). For info on the purchasing process, head over to [#acquisition](https://18f.slack.com/messages/acquisition), or to submit a new request, please [fill out this form](https://cap.18f.gov). Our resident expert on the subject is [Josh Bailes](https://18f.slack.com/messages/@bailes), with support from [Matt Spencer](https://18f.slack.com/messages/@mattspencer) and [Kathryn Connolly](https://18f.slack.com/messages/@kathryn).

Ops is your point of contact for **legal matters.** For most folks, this means one or two things: (1) non-personal ethics questions, which are discussed in [#legalstuff](https://18f.slack.com/messages/legalstuff); and (2) [interagency agreements (IAAs)](https://pages.18f.gov/iaa-forms/primer.html), which allow us to work with other agencies and get paid. Those are discussed over in [#iaa](https://18f.slack.com/messages/iaa). For personal ethics questions, please contact 18F's general counsel liaison, [John Peters](mailto:john.peters@gsa.gov).

If you have any questions, you can find us on Slack in [#acquisition](https://18f.slack.com/messages/acquisition), [#infrastructure](https://18f.slack.com/messages/infrastructure), [#equipment](https://18f.slack.com/messages/equipment), [#iaa](https://18f.slack.com/messages/iaa), [#legalstuff](https://18f.slack.com/messages/legalstuff), [#finance](https://18f.slack.com/messages/finance), [#pra](https://18f.slack.com/messages/pra), [#teamops](https://18f.slack.com/messages/teamops), and [#travel](https://18f.slack.com/messages/travel), as well as [your local office](/offices) channel.
