title: Onboarding schedule
---

_This series of onboarding classes is designed to explain how we work and introduce you to organizational best practices. All trainings take place in [#TTS-classes](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/messages/TTS-classes/)._

Most of these trainings are optional (with the exception of the [Infrastructure class](/classes/#infrastructure-team), which is required since it has critical legal, regulatory, and policy implications for your work). For the optional ones, if you have a conflicting team meeting or another commitment, prioritize that first! You can easily read a class chat log later.

## About the schedule

This is a typical onboarding schedule, but the timing may shift based on when you’re hired and federal holidays, etc. Check out the [TTS Classes Schedule](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=gsa.gov_gi2e1fc66fh4v5in8ogsm0v8oo%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FChicago) in Google Calendar for exact times.
