TTS employees are required to take the [following courses](/professional-development-and-training/#mandatory-training).

Note that there is a lag time of about four days between completing courses in OLU and having those courses reflected in your CHRIS profile.

You can log time spent in OLU as `71 - Training / Professional Development` in [Tock](/tock).

All General Services Administration (GSA) employees are required to take mandatory training courses providing critical information about how we work in the federal space. Time spent taking these trainings should be coded as `71 - Training / Prof Dev - Non Billable` in [Tock](https://tock.18f.gov/).  To take these courses, please log into [GSA&rsquo;s Online University (OLU)](https://gsaolu.gsa.gov). Please note: You may not have access to this for your first four to six weeks at TTS, although you can try [these steps to gain early access to OLU](/gsa-internal-tools/#online-university). Mandatory trainings include:

After you log into OLU, select a course, follow the in-browser video instructions, and take the exam. You'll receive a certification as soon as you pass the exam, but it may take about a week for the training to be uploaded into CHRIS, the GSA's electronic personnel file system.

For the *No Fear Act* training, we recommend using Firefox or Safari with IE8 User Agent. Otherwise, it won't register that you've taken the course. Upon completion of the test, you might not be able to click on the `Exit` button as is suggested. Try closing the window that the test was in and clicking next on the parent window &mdash; this should register your test as having been completed and generate the certification that is loaded to your profile.
