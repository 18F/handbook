The GSA [Online University (OLU)](https://gsaolu.gsa.gov/) is the home for mandatory trainings for federal employees.  Time spent taking OLU trainings should be coded as `969 - GSA-mandated Non-Billable Work` in [Tock](/tock).

Required classes will be assigned in OLU and pushed to TTS employees via email.  The following is an overview of required courses:

### Mandatory Annual Training for All Employees
* No Fear Act Training

* Sharing in a Collaborative Environment (C)
* Records Management Training
* Employee Accountability for GSA Personal Property

* OGE Form 450 Financial Disclosure (annual reporting for designated employees only)
* FY17 GSA PRIVACY 201 (designated employees only - PII)
* Telework for Employees 101

*NOTE: For the *No Fear Act* training, we recommend using Firefox or Safari with IE8 User Agent. Otherwise, it won't register that you've taken the course. Upon completion of the test, you might not be able to click on the `Exit` button as is suggested. Try closing the window that the test was in and clicking next on the parent window &mdash; this should register your test as having been completed and generate the certification that is loaded to your profile.*

## Help with OLU
For help with OLU once you've logged in, including getting confirmation of classes taken, click on the **Learning** dropdown at the top of the window and then select **Live Support 24/7**.

*Note that there is a lag time of about four days between completing courses in OLU and having those courses reflected in your CHRIS profile.*
