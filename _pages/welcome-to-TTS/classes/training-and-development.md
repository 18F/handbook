Funds are allocated to every office each year for training and development opportunities. If the money is not used by the end of the fiscal year we lose it!  So make sure to take advantage of this benefit GSA/TTS offers.

Supervisors are responsible for helping to guide employees to developmental opportunities and employees are responsible for taking the initiative to support their own development. These resources provide tops of how to seek ongoing growth opportunities:
