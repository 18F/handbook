## GSA tools

Most of GSA's internal tools are accessible via our Agency's intranet [Insite](http://insite.gsa.gov). You must be on the VPN to connect if you work remotely. [Instructions for connecting are here]({{site.baseurl}}/networks/). Here's an overview of what you can access (you can click the names in this table to scroll down the page):

| Name                                             | What we use it for                                                                                                                                         | Login system                           |

### Browser requirements

Please note that while many of these websites work fine in Chrome or Firefox, you _must_ use Safari or Internet Explorer to access Online University.

Let's cover each of these tools in a bit more detail.

## BookIt!

[BookIt!](https://bookit.gsa.gov/mobile/auth/spnego/spnegoLogin.jsp) is what you'll use to reserve a desk or a meeting room within a GSA building.

Here are some tips for employees that frequent an office:

<ul>
  <li>
    To periodically reserve a workstation in D.C.:
    <ol>
      <li>Go to `Profile → View Your Profile → Edit Profile`. </li>
      <li>Pick the workstation you'd like to reserve each day. TTS is on floor 3, Wing 1 and part of Wing 0 (Rooms 3007-3011)).</li>
      <li>Category: Workstation, Floor 3: Wing 1 or Floor 3: Wing 0. BookIT shows which workstations are equipped with Mac monitors.</li>
      <li>Choose the day of the week (today)</li>
      <li>Choose start and end times (typically, 9am and 6pm)</li>
      <li>Click save</li>
    </ol>
    Once your one-click settings are set up, you only have to hit two buttons each day: One-Click and Express Check-In (the top button on the left — arrow into door)
  </li>
  <li>BookIT! can remember your office location so you won't have to scroll through drop-down menus every time you need to reserve a meeting room. To save your office location settings, go to <code>Profile → View Your Profile → Edit Profile.</code>   </li>
  <li>BookIT! also allows you to add "delegates," or people who can book rooms and/or check in on your behalf. To do that, go to <code>Profile → View Your Profile → Delegates → Edit Profile</code>.</li>
  <li>Some employees have expressed difficulty in logging into BookIT! If you're having difficulty, try bookmarking <a href="https://bookit.gsa.gov/mobile/auth/spnego/spnegoLogin.jsp">the BookIT! login page</a>. It should immediately ask for your ENT password. In DC, you can also email <a href="mailto:1800ftenantsupport@gsa.gov">1800tenantsupport@gsa.gov</a> and ask to be added to the 18F org they should be able to add you to the list in a day.</li>
 </ul>

## Employee Express

[Employee Express](https://www.employeeexpress.gov/) is used to view your paystub, change your withholdings, change your health insurance plan, and change your address.

If you're new to GSA, it'll take a few weeks for IT to set up your account. (You should have access after your first paycheck.) You’ll receive a `Welcome to Employee Express` email with a security code.

1. You **must** click the first link first to activate your account.
2. Sign in with your temporary ID number (last five digits of your social security number).
3. After you activate your account, you can set up your login ID and password.
4. Then, go back to the welcome email and click the second link to log in.

Once your account is setup, be sure to log in right away as that initial access expires within a few days. If you have trouble logging in or need to contact the Employee Express Help Desk, click on the **(?)** icon in the top right hand corner of the [Employee Express](https://www.employeeexpress.gov/) main page and fill out the "Help Request" form.

If they ask for your health insurance code, you can see that in CHRIS under `GSA Personnel → Self Service → Employee Views → Benefits → Health Plan`. Your code is the number next to your health plan.

See [Benefits]({{site.baseurl}}/benefits) for more details about Employee Express.

## HR Links

<a href="https://corporateapps.gsa.gov/hr-links/">HR Links</a> is what you'll use to [request and document leave]({{site.baseurl}}/leave/) (sick, annual, bereavement, and more) as well as access your personnel file (your salary, your GS level, your supervisor, your past performance rating(s), and information about health insurance plan).

You must [be on the VPN](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nBNXt6Ov4KWmpz6y9rgKw93mxZucVsoYC4PFABTeIA4/edit#heading=h.bbs2uvvcjvcg) to connect to HR Links, if you're working remotely.

## IT Service Desk

_Also known as the GSA IT Help Desk or Service Now._

If you have any issues with a GSA-maintained system or website, you'll need to contact the IT service desk through:

- [The Service Portal](https://servicedesk.gsa.gov/), where you can submit a ticket or live chat
- Call them at 866-450-5250
- Email them at [itservicedesk@gsa.gov](mailto:itservicedesk@gsa.gov)

They are available 6am-9pm ET. If you need to reset your ENT password, follow [these instructions]({{ "/how-to-log-in/#changing-your-ent-password" | relative_url }}).

## Meeting Space

<a href="https://meet.gsa.gov/">Meeting Space</a> is the service you'll use to create your own conference call line, as opposed to our usual video calls in <a href="https://meet.google.com/">Google Hangouts Meet</a>. Hangouts Meet allow up to 99 participants plus a host: Meeting Space is usually only needed if you'll go beyond that number or your participants can't use Hangouts Meet. Here's how to create a Meeting Space call line:

1. Log in. Click `My Profile → My Audio Profiles`.
2. On the left hand side click `Intercall Audio Profile` to select it.
3. The right hand side of the screen will display the Intercall Audio Profile information that includes the conference code, leader pin, and conference phone number information. It'll look greyed out, but that's okay unless you want to edit it---for example, to change the PIN---if so, the edit button is at top right of that panel.

`My Audio Profile` is the only place that you will find the PIN needed to start any audio call outside of the meeting room.

That's it: your conference number is permanent! Yours to keep, forever. And when you need to use your conference number, you _do not_ need to schedule a meeting in Meeting Space. You just dial in with the leader code, and the number will be active for others using the participant code.

If you'd already set this up pre-February 2019, you may need to update it. Please reference the topical IT Insider email from February 2019 for instructions.

## Office supplies

TTS has an inventory of computer supplies, such a mice, keyboards, and trackpads on hand. If you’d like to check out Apple peripherals (for example, a Magic Mouse or wireless keyboard), make your request [here](https://docs.google.com/a/gsa.gov/forms/d/1d2Qa1KpjTGkn8yK_2cTY5UgMAtsJKQkNgQsqU_WBFKs/viewform).

Access to general office supplies varies based on your location — see our [office guides]({{site.baseurl}}/#18f-locations). The D.C. office has a supply center on the first floor of the GSA building. The supply center offers paper, pens, notebooks, and other basic office supplies (many of which can also be found in printer rooms throughout the building).

For software requests, see [Software](../software/).

If you need office supplies that aren’t available in your office, software, or need to make any other request for TTS to purchase, read on [here]({{site.baseurl}}/purchase-requests) for what to do next.
