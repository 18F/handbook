## Meeting tools

Here are some of the tools TTS uses to facilitate meetings:

- [Google Meet]({{site.baseurl}}/google-meet/)
- [Google Calendar]({{site.baseurl}}/google-calendar/)
- [Zoom]({{site.baseurl}}/zoom/)
- [Meeting Space]({{site.baseurl}}/gsa-internal-tools/#meeting-space) (for conference lines)
- Adobe Connect

## General meetings

### Compliance with GSA policies

Our agency maintains a formal meeting, conference, and event policy which may be found [here](<http://www.gsa.gov/portal/mediaId/205471/fileName/OAS_57851_Conference_and_Event_Management_(Signed_on_January_28__2015).action>). The most applicable part of this policy for TTS is the approval requirement for internal meetings that _require the travel of more than six employees or will cost more than $10,000._ For these meetings, approval of both the Commissioner of the Technology Transformation Service and the Deputy Administrator of GSA via the [Salesforce Event Tracker](https://gsa.my.salesforce.com/a1b/o) system. For further information and help getting your request submitted, go to the [#training-conferences](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/messages/training-conferences) Slack channel.

### TTS Townhalls

You'll hear well in advance about any upcoming townhalls, which should give you ample time to plan (and rearrange your schedule, if necessary). Conversations during Townhall meetings take place in the Slack channel [#townhall](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/messages/townhall).

### Location-specific meetings

Individual offices have rituals that you might want to take part in. Check in your local office Slack channel for more information!

### Guilds and working groups

[Working groups and guilds]({{site.baseurl}}/working-groups-and-guilds-101) shape culture, frameworks, and discipline best practices across TTS. You don't have to become a permanent member of a working group to attend meetings.

### OPP All Hands

OPP All Hands are a monthly, 1.5 hour opportunity for OPPers to hear updates from leadership, share kudos, welcome new teammates, learn about new initiatives within the team and across the division, and hear news and updates from existing programs. They typically take place on the third Tuesday of the month at 1 pm EST.
