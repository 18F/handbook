## How to update the handbook

Everyone, inside and outside TTS, can submit contributions to https://github.com/18F/handbook as a pull request or [open an issue](https://github.com/18F/handbook/issues/new) with a suggestion. If you're part of TTS, you can also chat about ideas in [#tts-handbook](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/messages/tts-handbook) or [#wg-onboarding](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/messages/wg-onboarding).

There is no dedicated staff for the handbook; maintenance is done by TTS staff who are interested in helping.

For long or important chunks of writing, consider asking the [18F Writing Lab](https://github.com/18F/writing-lab) to review and edit  before you propose significant changes to the handbook.

### Pull requests (PRs)

Each pull request should be reviewed by at least one other TTS staff member before merging. Once a PR is approved, anyone can merge it (including the original submitter).

If you make a pull request that's best reviewed by a specific person, tag or assign it to that person. It can also help to ping them in Slack to ask for review.

### How to review and merge pull requests

Any TTS staff member can review a pull request. If it's not your area of expertise, ask somebody who has expertise in that area (for instance, by commenting to tag a person or sharing the PR in Slack). If the author of the pull request added a specific person as a reviewer, hold off merging the pull request until the specified reviewer has had a chance to review it. 

If you're not sure, ask for a second opinion in #tts-handbook first.

## Content and accessibility

The handbook follows the [18F content guide](https://content-guide.18f.gov), and all content should follow web accessibility best practices. Remember to use [descriptive link text](https://content-guide.18f.gov/urls-and-filenames/#link-text) and avoid "click here" links.
