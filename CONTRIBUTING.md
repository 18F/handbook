## How to update the handbook

Everyone (both inside and outside CivicActions) can submit contributions to https://github.com/CivicActions/handbook as a pull request or [open an issue](https://github.com/CivicActions/handbook/issues/new) with a suggestion. If you're part of CivicActions, you can also chat about ideas in [#docs](https://civicactions.slack.com/messages/docs/).

There is no dedicated staffing for the handbook right now; maintenance is done in spare time by any CivicActions staff member who is interested in helping.

If you make a pull request related to a subject that is the responsibility of a specific team or person, please consider tagging or assigning it to that team or person (or pinging them in Slack to ask them to review it).

Each pull request should be reviewed by at least one other CivicActions staff member before we merge it (in other words, don't merge your own pull requests), as a general good practice.

### How to review and merge pull requests

Any CivicActions staff member can review a pull request and decide whether they feel confident about merging it. If it's not your area of expertise, ask somebody at CivicActions who has expertise in that area.

For example: if something looks like it's related to how Marketing works, ask a Marketing person to review it; if it looks like it needs Project Management team review, ask a PM.

If you're not sure if you should merge something, ask for a second opinion in [#docs](https://civicactions.slack.com/messages/docs/) first.

## Styles

This will be fleshed out in future iterations. For now, keep in mind that content appearing in the handbook should exemplify best practices with regard to content. Handbook content should be welcoming, personable, and free from jargon.
