### Initial setup for travel

In order to travel officially in TTS, you need to, at minimum, [get set up in Concur]({{site.baseurl}}/first-time-travel-get-in-concur/)\*, GSA's travel system. Flights or Amtrak booked in Concur are paid for directly by GSA-- no travel card required.

You'll also want to [apply for a GSA travel card]({{site.baseurl}}/first-time-travel-travel-card/), and once you receive it, [update your Concur profile]({{site.baseurl}}/first-time-travel-complete-concur-profile). This process takes about two weeks. In the meantime, you won't be able to make hotel reservations in Concur. It is recommended that you make all of your reservations via AdTrav at (877) 472-6716 until your card arrives. You will need to use your personal funds for all travel expenses other than flights/rail, but can be reimbursed for all official expenses when you [complete a voucher upon your return]({{site.baseurl}}/travel-guide-3-reimbursement/).

\*_Note: there are [special procedures]({{site.baseurl}}/first-time-travel-get-in-concur-pre-olu/) for staff who need to get into Concur to travel during their first week and may not yet have access to OLU to complete the required IT security trainings._

### Brief overview of how to travel

Once you are [set up in Concur]({{site.baseurl}}/first-time-travel-get-in-concur/) and your [travel card]({{site.baseurl}}/first-time-travel-travel-card/) is on its way, there are three main parts of the travel process to be aware of:

1. [Booking flights/rail, hotels, and rental cars]({{site.baseurl}}/travel-guide-1-book-travel/) in [Concur](https://travel.gsa.gov) or via AdTrav at (877) 472-6716, [completing trip information]({{site.baseurl}}/travel-and-leave/travel-and-leave-policies/travel-guide-faq/#completing-trip-information) and [stamping and submitting]({{site.baseurl}}/travel-and-leave/travel-and-leave-policies/travel-guide-faq/#how-to-stamp-and-submit-for-travel-team-approval) in [Concur](https://travel.gsa.gov), and [securing approval either via email]({{site.baseurl}}/travel-and-leave/travel-and-leave-policies/travel-guide-faq/#how-to-secure-authorizing-official-approval) from your [authorizing official]({{site.baseurl}}/travel-and-leave/travel-and-leave-policies/travel-guide-faq/#who-is-my-authorizing-official-and-what-is-my-budget), or through the [event request process]({{site.baseurl}}/travel-and-leave/travel-and-leave-policies/travel-guide-faq/#how-can-i-get-my-travel-approved-to-attend-a-training-conference-speaking-event-or-other-irl-or-large-team-gathering)
