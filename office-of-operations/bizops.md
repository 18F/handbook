The Business Operations Division leads the day to day operations of the organization and delivers on the TTS strategy and
operational plans.

This division is made up of four teams and responsible for the following functions:

# Agreements

The TTS Agreements Team works with business units to ensure Interagency Agreements (IAAs), Memoranda of
Understanding (MOUs), and Intergovernmental Cooperation Act Agreements (IGCAs) are completed before providing or receiving
services to or from partner agencies, offices, state or local governments. The team works closely with TTS business units and
partners, as well as the TTS finance team, OCFO, and OGC to ensure our agreements are in compliance with legal and financial
guidance. We track agreements from the time they are requested by a business unit until they are fully executed and processed. The team also provides data and business intelligence to help leadership forecast business volume and develop business development strategies.
