# <a name="introduction"></a>INTRODUCTION

## <a name="welcome"></a>Welcome to Our Company!

We’re very happy to welcome you to our company. You have joined an organization that has established an outstanding reputation for quality products and services. Credit for this goes to every one of us. We believe you are a very good fit and will benefit from - and thoroughly enjoy - being part of an amazing team.

## <a name="history"></a>Background / History
CivicActions, Inc. is a global professional services firm delivering innovative technology strategy, creative design, and mobile and web development services for the world’s leading progressive non-profits, foundations, socially responsible businesses and, most recently, various Federal and local government agencies. 


CivicActions started in 2004 and is now established as one of the leaders in both the Agile and Drupal communities. We have served over 175 clients including the Center for Reproductive Rights, American Public Media, Amnesty International and the San Francisco Human Services Agency. The work we do allows us to contribute to important causes - promoting sustainability, social justice, human rights and environmental protection. We believe in delivering excellent work, having fun doing it, surrounding ourselves with super people and creating opportunities to learn and grow. We also believe in nurturing a lifestyle that allows each of our team members to create a balanced, impactful life.

## <a name="purpose"></a>Handbook Purpose
This Handbook has been prepared to tell you about CivicActions’ philosophy, employment practices, policies, benefits, and the conduct we expect from ourselves. 


CivicActions operates transparently on a fundamental level. We have very few “rules and regulations.” We expect everyone, individually and collectively, to be forthright, trustworthy, ethical and have a sense of humor. Because we expect it, we attract people who demonstrate exactly these qualities. Left to our own devices, this Handbook would be very short - be open, do your best, ask for help and clarification when you need it, and have fun. 


That being said, there are topics in this document that are required by law or at least by HR professionals. You will find them further down under “Required Stuff.” This Handbook is not designed to answer specific questions or address specific scenarios. It is more likely to be a springboard for conversations that will allow us to express our views, get to know each other better, and continually improve harmonious relationships. Issues are addressed on a case-by-case basis anyway. We do want you to feel free to discuss anything with team members and/or management, whether it’s something that disturbs you, something that confuses you or something that excites you.   You will find CivicActions a great place to work.

# <a name="employ"></a>EMPLOYMENT

## <a name="equal-opportunities"></a>Equal Employment Opportunities
CivicActions provides equal employment opportunities to “all qualified people”. What that means can be found under “Required Stuff” below.

[Return to Table of Contents](#toc)

## <a name="background-check"></a>Background Checks
As casual as we are in many areas, CivicActions is a responsible, successful, for-profit business and we do apply some standard business practices. For example, we will almost certainly verify prior employment and check professional references. We may confirm your education before making you an offer. It is also possible that a security check may be required by certain clients from time to time. Third-party services may be hired to perform these checks.

[Return to Table of Contents](#toc)

## <a name="immigration-law"></a>Immigration Law Compliance
All CivicActions’ employees hired to work in the U.S. need to complete a Form I-9 and produce proof of identity and eligibility to work. These documents will be kept in your confidential electronic personnel file and we will need them as soon as your Employment Agreement is signed.

[Return to Table of Contents](#toc)

## <a name="employment-classification"></a>Employment Classifications
CivicActions has established the following Employee Classifications for compensation and benefit purposes only. 


Regular Full-Time Employee: An employee who is scheduled to work no less than 40 hours in a work week . The employee is eligible for all employment benefits offered by CivicActions.


Regular Part-Time Employee: An employee who is scheduled to work less than 40 hours in a workweek. Regular part-time employees working at least 30 hours a week are eligible for all employment benefits offered by CivicActions.


Whether an employee is exempt or non-exempt depends on specific, statutory tests. See "Required Stuff" below.  For our purposes, exempt employees don’t get overtime and non-exempt do.

[Return to Table of Contents](#toc)

## <a name="personrecord"></a>Personnel (and Personal) Records
CivicActions will maintain a secure electronic employment file while you remain an employee. This file contains things like I-9s and a copy of I-9 identification, W-4s, and Employment Agreements, and possibly other appropriate documents, on an individual basis. Our accounting and banking providers also have secure files which contain information like social security numbers and bank routing information. 


If you have any changes to personal information, such as a change of address, phone number or name, we ask that you notify admin so the changes show up in all of your records - and on the Team Roster, in case somebody wants to send you a birthday card.

[Return to Table of Contents](#toc)

## <a name="employee-reference"></a>Employee References
CivicActions will only confirm employment and provide employment dates and the positions held in response to third parties inquiries. 

[Return to Table of Contents](#toc)

# <a name="conduct-behavior"></a>CONDUCT AND BEHAVIOR

[Return to Table of Contents](#toc)

## <a name="general-guideline"></a>General Guidelines
Successful operation of CivicActions requires that all of us be respectful of, and open with, one another.  This is a community of trust and it needs straight-forward, non-critical dialogue to accomplish its goals. There’s little that can’t be resolved with honest appraisal and an attitude of cooperation. We don’t compete here, and we try really hard to avoid back-biting and complaining.


That’s not to say we don’t annoy or otherwise drive each other a little nuts occasionally. It happens. If an issue is not easily resolved, there is a “Complaint Resolution Policy” in “Required Stuff” below.

[Return to Table of Contents](#toc)

## <a name="confident"></a>Confidentiality
This paragraph is simply intended to alert employees to the need for discretion and is not intended to inhibit normal business communications.  For further information, refer to the “Confidential Information and Inventions Agreement” you signed when you were hired.

[Return to Table of Contents](#toc)

## <a name="outside-activity"></a>Outside Activities
You may engage in outside employment or personal educational activities during non-working hours, provided that such activities do not interfere with your job performance or constitute a conflict of interest. 


[Return to Table of Contents](#toc)

## <a name="code-conduct"></a>Code of Conduct
Within a virtual working environment communication is vital to keeping a collaborative, healthy and fun atmosphere. We want to foster an open, inclusive, and diverse culture with the freedom to be ourselves. With that in mind we also want to ensure that everyone here is treated fairly and also feels safe and welcome. We have a variety of communication tools and forums, including Slack, Hangouts, and in-person events, and the code of conduct is intended for all of them.


CivicActions is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, age, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form and employees who violate this code of conduct may be subject to disciplinary actions.


Be mindful. Having a diverse team means that we will have different opinions, viewpoints and experiences. This also means that we may not agree on what is humorous, insulting or rude. We all stand to learn from each other and that includes gaining awareness to how others perceive certain communications. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.


Be friendly and welcoming. As our team grows, we are more likely to have peers that we don’t directly work with. We all have an opportunity to be friendly in other arenas to get to know each other, including retreats, pod calls, and social slack channels. Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of the company.


Be considerate and respectful. We all have a voice and some of us happen to be louder than others. 
When in a discussion or sharing a thought, think before you speak, and give others a chance to be heard. When disagreeing about something, focus on resolving issues constructively and ask for help when needed.


If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct, please speak to your manager or Henry Poole.

# <a name="compensate"></a>COMPENSATION

[Return to Table of Contents](#toc)

## <a name="pay-period"></a>Pay Periods
The standard workweek for CivicActions is 12:01 a.m. Sunday through midnight the following Saturday. This is only important if you’re a non-exempt employee who is eligible for overtime.


We have semi-monthly pay days. The first pay period is from the first through the fifteenth of the month and the second from the sixteenth through the end of the month.


Paychecks are direct deposited on the 25th day of the month for the first pay period, and on the 10th day of the following month for the second. If the 10th or 25th fall on a Saturday, Sunday or holiday, you will be paid on the preceding business day.

[Return to Table of Contents](#toc)

## <a name="overtimepay"></a>Overtime 	
Any overtime needs to be pre-approved by a manager or member of the management team. 


CivicActions complies with all applicable laws regarding payment of overtime work. Overtime is based on the laws of the state in which the employee lives and, as of this writing, our only non-exempt employees are New Yorkers. Information about other states will be added as needed.


New York: overtime is paid at the rate of 1-1/2 times the regular rate of pay for hours worked over 40 in a payroll week

[Return to Table of Contents](#toc)

## <a name="pay-adjustment"></a>Pay Adjustments
There are no schedules or guaranteed cost of living or salary adjustments. 

[Return to Table of Contents](#toc)

## <a name="mileage"></a>Mileage Reimbursement
CivicActions will reimburse employees at the IRS “business standard mileage rate” for miles traveled by the employee in the employee's car while on CivicActions’ business.

[Return to Table of Contents](#toc)

## <a name="business-expense"></a>Business-Related Expenses
CivicActions will timely reimburse business-related out-of-pocket expenses as long as you submit a receipt.  For multiple expenses, e.g., a business trip, we also will need an expense report which can be found at:

# <a name="prodev-compar"></a>PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT and COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION

[Return to Table of Contents](#toc)

## <a name="background-why"></a>Background - The Why
CivicActions set a goal of developing individual Professional Development plans for all team members in early 2014.  We also set a goal of strengthening Community Participation in 2014 and leveraging the intersection of participation and Marketing (See 5% Presentation).
We value Professional Development and Community Participation because they increase our skillsets, make us more valuable to our clients and result in stories that can be used to market CivicActions.


Below is a first flush implementation which we believe will enable us to address our goals.  We anticipate future revisions, based on retrospective feedback and learnings.

[Return to Table of Contents](#toc)

## <a name="logistics-policy"></a>Logistics & Policy Information
Below are the initial logistic and policy information.  We shall assess these as part of future retrospectives and update as needed.
	
Each team member shall meet with their line manager for a Professional Development and Community Participation meeting.  
We are planning for 2 meetings in 2014, where the 2nd meeting would include a retrospective of the workflow/logistics as well as the specific vision, plan and implementation sections.  We do not know what the ideal frequency will be, (e.g. yearly, twice yearly, quarterly etc) so will be trying out some options and reflecting to identify an effective, achievable and scalable frequency.

The output of this meeting will be an initial Professional Development and Community Participation plan, customized to address  individual needs and captured on a Trello board.  Please see Rollout section at the link below for additional information and guidance.

Each full-time team member is eligible for a yearly stipend of $1,200.

The stipend will be pro rata for team members contracted to work less than full-time (40 hours/week).

New team members will have a 3-month (90 day) wait period before becoming eligible for a professional development stipend.
		
No more than 20% of the team can be out on planned vacation & professional development events at a time.  We are assessing if the % should be per department or company-wide.
	
Two (2) months’ notice  is needed on spends above $300. From time to time we may also cap the total monthly professional development spend across the company, dependent on the budget and cash flow outlook for the month.

Purchases under $50 can be made without approval, as long as they support professional development goals.  Receipts and expense sheets should be submitted in the usual way, noting as professional development costs.

# <a name="benefit"></a>BENEFITS

[Return to Table of Contents](#toc)

## <a name="holiday"></a>Holidays
The following holidays are observed by CivicActions and the office is considered closed:

* New Year's Day . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . January 1st
* Martin Luther King's Birthday  . . . . . . Third Monday in January
* Memorial Day . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Last Monday in May
* Independence Day . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . July 4th

* Thanksgiving . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Fourth Thursday in November and the following Friday
* Christmas . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . December 25th


Employees are not encouraged to work on holidays; however, if you feel it’s necessary for your own peace of mind, hourly employees will be compensated at their normal hourly rate. Full-time employees who voluntarily work on designated holidays will not receive additional compensation.

[Return to Table of Contents](#toc)

## <a name="pto"></a>Paid Time Off
PTO applies to exempt employees. We do not accrue sick days, vacation days or any other form of PTO. Instead, employees are encouraged to take time off as needed to feel balanced, productive and healthy.


You do not need to justify paid time off but, except for unexpected events or emergencies, it does need to be arranged in advance so the work will be covered. There is a procedure for this:


if you are working on an active project, discuss the impact of your absence with your project manager (this is especially important if there is flexibility in your dates);
email ca-timeoff@lists.civicactions.net requesting the time;

when the PTO is approved, your manager will simply “reply-all” to your original email and admin will put it on the Master Calendar
Any time under ½ day, e.g., time for doctor appointments, does not need to be formalized.  Just let your PM know;


If you are unexpectedly unable to work for any reason (e.g., illness, emergency, power outage), email ca-timeoff@lists.civicactions.net.  It is not sufficient to notify only a member of your team or post something in Slack. If you do not have internet access, you can call our main number, 510-408-7510 but this is not an efficient way to get the word out.  Better to have your manager's phone number handy.

PTO will be recorded simply to easily see any patterns that might otherwise be overlooked, including non-use. Unless it will cause an extreme hardship on the company and your team, no request for PTO under two weeks will be turned down.

[Return to Table of Contents](#toc)

## <a name="leave-absense"></a>Personal Leave of Absence
Employees of CivicActions, including part-time employees, who have worked  for at least one (1) year  may request a personal leave of absence. A leave of absence is for extended periods, typically 4 weeks or more, where an employee is fully or part-time away from work, for example taking courses/training, handling extended personal matters, completing a personal project, or world travel. Leaves will be discussed on a case by case basis and may be paid, partially paid or unpaid. 

[Return to Table of Contents](#toc)

## <a name="maternity"></a>Maternity and Paternity Leave
Welcoming a new baby is an amazing time for a family and we want to support employees during this time to take the time to bond with their new child (by birth or adoption) and acclimate to the new life ahead. Our policy is that expectant mothers can take twelve weeks of maternity leave fully paid after 9 months of employment and expectant fathers can take four weeks of paternity leave fully paid after 9 months of employment. If an employee has been at the company for less than 9 months or if for any reason the expectant mother or father needs additional leave, we will review requests on a case-by-case basis. 

[Return to Table of Contents](#toc)

## <a name="medical"></a>Medical Insurance
All full-time regular employees and part-time hourly employees who work at least 30 hours a week are entitled to benefits under CivicActions' medical, dental, vision and and life insurance plans. CivicActions pays 100% of the premiums, unless you opt for a medical benefits program that includes name-brand prescription coverage.  Then you pay the difference.


New full-time employees joining CivicActions will be eligible for coverage on the first of the month following thirty (30) days from the date of employment. If, as a new employee, you do not want the coverage, you will need to tell admin in case it puts us out of compliance with the plan providers.

[Return to Table of Contents](#toc)

## <a name="tuition"></a>Tuition Reimbursement
Employees are encouraged to take education and training courses related to their profession. When appropriate, and with prior approval, CivicActions will pay for all or a portion of such courses.

[Return to Table of Contents](#toc)

## <a name="private-automobile"></a>Use of Private Automobile
If your job requires you to operate your personal vehicle for CivicActions’ business, CivicActions needs proof of a current and valid state driver’s license and proof of insurance.
 
If you are involved in an automobile accident while on CivicActions’ business, report the accident to your manager immediately. Request a police report and obtain anything available to you at the scene of the accident.

[Return to Table of Contents](#toc)

## <a name="drugs-alcohol"></a>Drugs and Alcohol
CivicActions has a zero tolerance policy regarding the use of drugs and alcohol while on the job. That being said, the moderate use of alcohol at Company-approved meetings, with business meals, travel, entertainment, or in an appropriate social setting, is not prohibited by this policy.

[Return to Table of Contents](#toc)

# <a name="employseparation"></a>EMPLOYMENT SEPARATION

[Return to Table of Contents](#toc)

## <a name="at-will"></a>At-Will Employment
All employment with CivicActions, or any other company doing business in the U.S., is “at will”. The relationship can be terminated by the employee or by CivicActions at any time, for any or no reason, and without notice. But being who we are, we typically work together for a smooth transition.

[Return to Table of Contents](#toc)

## <a name="resig"></a>Resignation
Employees are asked to provide a minimum of 2 weeks written notice of their intent to resign. The notice should be submitted to the employee’s manager or to one of the management team.  An exit interview may be requested.

[Return to Table of Contents](#toc)

## <a name="termin"></a>Termination 
If CivicActions sees a problem with an employee’s performance, or there is otherwise clearly a bad fit between the employee and CivicActions, every effort will be made to remedy the issue(s). (See “Corrective Action” below). If termination turns out to be the only solution, it will never be without notice and the employee will be fully aware of, and probably in agreement with, the reasons.

[Return to Table of Contents](#toc)

## <a name="company-property"></a>Return of Company Property
Any company property issued to employees, such as documents, computer equipment or company credit cards, must be returned to CivicActions at the time of separation. 

[Return to Table of Contents](#toc)

## <a name="continuation-benefit"></a>Continuation of Benefits 
Cal-COBRA is California law that has similar provisions to federal COBRA. With Cal-COBRA, you will have the benefit of coverage for a full 36 months.


Many other states have “mini-COBRAs” which serve the same purpose as Cal-COBRA. If you live in one of those states, you have the option of using the benefits provided by that state instead of (not in addition to) Cal-COBRA. Cal-COBRA is by far the most generous; however, it is also the most expensive.

## <a name="atwillnotice"></a>At-Will Notice
In the United States, all employment is At-Will. You are not hired for any definite or specified period of time even though your wages are paid regularly. You are an at-will employee of CivicActions and your employment can be terminated at any time, with or without cause and with or without prior notice. Company policy requires all employees to be hired at-will and this policy cannot be changed by any oral modifications. There have been no implied or verbal agreements or promises to you that you will be discharged only under certain circumstances or after certain procedures are followed. There is no implied employment contract created by this Handbook or any other Company document or written or verbal statement or policy


Only authorized management may alter or modify any of the policies in this Employee Handbook with the exception of the “At-Will Employment” provision, which cannot be altered by anybody. Nothing in this handbook is intended to infringe upon employee rights under Section Seven (7) of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA). See http://www.nlrb.gov/national-labor-relations-act if you’re curious about it.

## <a name="equal-employment"></a>Equal Employment - Expanded Definition
CivicActions provides equal employment opportunities and administers all aspects and conditions of employment without regard to race, religion, color, gender, sexual orientation, pregnancy, age, national origin, ancestry, physical or mental disability, severe/morbid obesity, medical condition, military or veteran status, genetic information, marital status, ethnicity, alienage or any other protected classification, in accordance with applicable federal, state, and local laws. CivicActions takes allegations of discrimination, intimidation, harassment and retaliation very seriously and will promptly conduct an investigation when warranted.


Equal employment opportunity includes, but is not limited to, employment, training, promotion, demotion, transfer, leaves of absence, and termination.

[Return to Table of Contents](#toc)

## <a name="reasonable-accomodation"></a>Reasonable Accommodations 
It is the policy of CivicActions to comply with all the relevant and applicable provisions of the federal Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), as well as state and local laws concerning the employment of persons with disabilities. CivicActions will not discriminate against any qualified employee or job applicant because of a person’s physical or mental disability with respect to any terms, privileges, or conditions of employment, including but not limited to hiring, advancement, discharge, compensation, and training.


Employees who become disabled should notify administration if the conditions of the disability impair their ability to perform the essential functions of their position. Where necessary and feasible, reasonable accommodations will be made for qualified disabled employees to perform the essential functions of the job in question, as long as the accommodation does not cause CivicActions undue hardship.

[Return to Table of Contents](#toc)

## <a name="exempt-non"></a>Exempt v. Non-exempt
Exempt: Employees whose positions meet specific tests established by the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and applicable state law and who are exempt from overtime pay requirements. The basic premise of exempt status is that the exempt employee is to work the hours required to meet his/her work responsibilities. This includes managers and assistant managers as well as designated office personnel.


Non-exempt: Employees whose positions do not meet FLSA and state exemption tests and who are paid a multiple of their regular rate of pay for overtime hours worked.

## <a name="complaint-resolution"></a>Complaint Resolution Policy


CivicActions subscribes to an open door policy. If an issue arises that cannot be worked out directly, you are encouraged to bring a particular complaint to your manager for resolution. When matters cannot be handled on an informal basis, CivicActions has established a formal procedure for a fair review of any work related controversy, dispute or misunderstanding, including intimidation, harassment or bullying.  We have a zero tolerance policy concerning those behaviors and, actually, can’t imagine them ever happening here.


A complaint may be brought by one or more employees concerning any work-related problem where the complaint has not been satisfactorily resolved in an informal manner.


Step 1 - The complaint must be submitted in writing to management or within 3 working days of an incident. A written request for a meeting must be submitted simultaneously. Generally, a meeting will be held within 3 working days of the employee's request. Witnesses will be allowed as necessary. If the problem is not resolved during this meeting management will give the employee a written resolution within 3 working days. If the employee is not satisfied, the employee may proceed to Step 2.


Step 2 - If the employee is not satisfied after Step 1, the employee may submit a written request for review of the complaint and Step 2 solution to the CEO or appointed representative. Such a request must be made within 3 working days following the receipt of the Step 1 resolution. The CEO or appointed representative will review the complaint and proposed solution and may call a further meeting to explore the problem. This meeting is to be attended by the employee concerned, the employee's immediate manager, and any other employee of CivicActions whom the aggrieved employee chooses. The CEO or appointed representative will render the final decision within 10 working days after receiving the Step 2 request. The decision will be given to the employee in writing and will become part of the employee's personnel file.

[Return to Table of Contents](#toc)

## <a name="corrective"></a>Corrective Action
A high level of job performance and ethical behavior is expected of you. 


In the event that your job performance does not meet the standards established for your position, you should seek assistance from your manager to attain an acceptable level of performance. If you fail to respond to or fail to make positive efforts toward improvement, corrective action may ensue.


If you violate established Company procedures, guidelines, or exhibit behavior that violates  CivicActions' standards of honesty and integrity or creates an appearance of impropriety, CivicActions may elect to administer disciplinary action.

[Return to Table of Contents](#toc)

## <a name="irregularity"></a>Reporting Irregularities
It is the responsibility of each employee of CivicActions to report to a member of the management team any irregularities indicating actual or suspected existence of a loss, fraud, embezzlement or similar impairment of funds or property, or other suspicious activity.

[Return to Table of Contents](#toc)

## <a name="conflict-interest"></a>Conflict of Interest
You know and share the values of our culture here, with an emphasis on integrity and transparency, and conflict of interest will not often be an issue, if ever. But, if you question the propriety of a transaction or activity that involves CivicActions or employees/contractors of CivicActions, or a client, or if an outside activity you may be considering raises questions in your mind, talk to your manager or one of the management team.

Updated the PTO policy so that the only email address that needs to be used to request time off is  ca-timeoff@lists.civicactions.net


September 30, 2015


The PTO policy has been modified as follows:  


“PTO applies to exempt employees. We do not accrue sick days, vacation days or any other form of PTO. Instead, employees are encouraged to take time off as needed to feel balanced, productive and healthy.


You do not need to justify paid time off but, except for unexpected events or emergencies, it does need to be arranged in advance so the work will be covered. There is a procedure for this:


if you are working on an active project, discuss the impact of your absence with your project manager (this is especially important if there is flexibility in your dates);
email your manager, project manager, Elizabeth and ca-admingroup@lists.civicactions.net requesting the time;
Any time under ½ day, e.g., time for doctor appointments, does not need to be formalized.  Just let your PM know;
when the PTO is approved, your manager will simply “reply-all” to your original email and admin will put it on the Master Calendar


If you are unexpectedly unable to work for any reason (e.g., illness, emergency, power outage), email your manager, project manager and ca-admingroup@lists.civicactions.net.  It is not sufficient to notify only a member of your team or post something in Slack. If you do not have internet access, you can call our main number, 510-408-7510 but this is not an efficient way to get the word out.  Better to have your manager's phone number handy.

Paid Time Off update from “Unless it will cause an extreme hardship on the company and your team, no request for PTO will be turned down.” to “Unless it will cause an extreme hardship on the company and your team, no request for PTO under two weeks will be turned down.”


Personal Leave of Absence update from “Leaves will be discussed on a case by case basis and may be paid, partially paid or unpaid. Any leave that lasts for less than a month would fall under the PTO policy.” to  “A leave of absence is for extended periods, typically 4 weeks or more, where an employee is fully or part-time away from work, for example taking courses/training, handling extended personal matters, completing a personal project, or world travel. Leaves will be discussed on a case by case basis and may be paid, partially paid or unpaid.”


Maternity and Paternity Policy added: “Welcoming a new baby is an amazing time for a family and we want to support employees during this time to take the time to bond with their new child (by birth or adoption) and acclimate to the new life ahead. Our policy is that expectant mothers can take twelve weeks of maternity leave fully paid after 9 months of employment and expectant fathers can take four weeks of paternity leave fully paid after 9 months of employment. If an employee has been at the company for less than 9 months or if for any reason the expectant mother or father needs additional leave, we will review requests on a case-by-case basis.”
