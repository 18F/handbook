The [Daily Check-in Tool](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfYiHZUx3FzMtK8pWr6uaq8G3thltGK7hUaGmyhDLBSERfx2w/viewform) gathers data that the GSA Leadership Team, including the Administrator, reviews on a daily basis as part of the agencyâ€™s COVID planning and response. The goal for the check-in tool is 100% reporting every day.
