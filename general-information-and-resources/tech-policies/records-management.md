Records are written words, video recordings, etc. that are attributable back to you. This page outlines how to properly treat federal records.

## Guidelines

All GSA employees are responsible for records management. The widespread use of electronic mail ([GMail]({{site.baseurl}}/gmail/)) and electronic records through GSAâ€™s online applications has highlighted the need for everyone to understand how to determine which documents are Federal records and how to manage them effectively. Records serve a number of purposes, including:

- planning administrative and program needs
- documenting GSA activities
- protecting the agency's legal and financial rights
- providing for adequate oversight by Congress and other authorized agencies
- documenting the agency's history
- providing continuity of operations during an emergency or disaster

Records are critical to an organization to function effectively and efficient. [Visit GSA Insite Records Management Page](https://insite.gsa.gov/topics/directives-forms-and-regulations/records-management) for general procedures on identifying Federal records, determining what documents are needed to document Agency activities, for official files and managing records in accordance with the law.
