# Documentation Governance

The docs working group expect changes and additions to this handbook to come out of solutions to “struggles” or “tensions” discussed within practice area working groups (such as the PM Group, the Sales Guild, etc).

## Process

- Each practice area shall assign one person from that area to be responsible for documentation updates for a certain period of time.
- The trial time period for “documentation rep” responsibilities shall be one month, followed by a handoff to the next rep from that practice area.
- Each practice area is encouraged to organize their folder in the handbook according to their needs and priorities.
- Current documentation reps are asked to attend a brief weekly docs scrum call, currently scheduled for Thursdays at 12:30pm Pacific time.

## Practice Areas

We have identified the following practice areas. Not all of these areas currently have associated working groups or folders within the handbook, though creating such groups and folders would probably be beneficial for documentation and cross-organization knowledge-sharing efforts.

- Engineering
 - Front end
 - DevOps
 - Backend
- Sales/Marketing (could be split into two areas)
- Design
- Security
- UX/Design
- Project Management/Agile
- HR/Admin

## Handbook Structure

The handbook currently includes folders for the following areas, which correlate with some of the practice areas listed above (this structure can and probably should be expanded to be inclusive of all practice areas):

- [Engineering](/05-engineering)
- [Project Management](/06-project-management)
- [Agile Baseline](/04-how-we-work/agile-baseline)
- [Sales and Marketing](/07-sales-and-marketing)
- [HR/Admin](/08-hr-admin)
- [Security](09-security)

## Documentation Rep Responsibilities

- Act as a liaison between practice area and documentation working group
- Responsible for maintaining the most up-to-date documentation for designated practice area
- Specific activities may include creating tickets on the [Documentation Working Group Trello board](https://trello.com/b/ZKx6l4bC/documentation-working-group) to ensure that learnings/decisions coming out of practice area meetings and retrospectives are captured, and/or updating/writing new content, making commits, and creating PRs in this repo
