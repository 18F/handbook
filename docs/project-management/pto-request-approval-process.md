# PTO Request and Approval Process

When a team member requests Paid Time Off (PTO), the Project Manager has a unique role in the approval process:

1. The team member confirms with their PM that PTO plans work with the project schedule
2. The PM compares the PTO request with the project schedule and makes the decision (_rarely is PTO declined_)
3. The PM and the team member discuss if/how the PTO impacts the project schedule and discuss coverage if needed (_i.e. who picks up  the slack in ticket work?_)
4. Assuming the PM approves the PTO, the team member goes through the [formal process for requesting time off](https://github.com/CivicActions/handbook#pto)
5. The Delivery Manager approves the PTO via email reply and requests that Judy add the PTO to the Master Calendar
6. The PM enters the PTO into Resource Guru
7. As the PTO date approaches, the PM and the team member work through project impacts and coverage together
8. The PM and the team member notify the rest of the team about the PTO
