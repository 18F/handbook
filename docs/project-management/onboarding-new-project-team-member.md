# Project Team Member Onboarding Process

* The PM & TL should meet with the person before they begin to discuss the project and set expectations
* If the new person is a contractor, the PM & TL will first interview the contractor for fit in terms of team & work capabilities.
* The PM should write a follow up email outlining what was discussed, linking to necessary documents, sharing helpful screenshots, outlining next steps, expectations, etc.
* The PM should create a ticket (for the sprint or backlog) to track onboarding the new team member to the project
* That ticket should capture all the steps the new team member should go through to be onboarded to the project (granting account access, discussing time tracking, getting their SSH key, contractor SoW, inviting them to email lists, explaining balance scores, access to our tools like Slack, etc).
* This ticket should include the notes from the initial meeting call / interview.
* The PM should provide good examples of properly logged time, ticket management processes, writing an acceptance test and QA steps, etc. These can also be screenshots, and linked Google documents.
* If the person is a contractor, the PM should prepare on "Offboard Card" to ensure they are properly removed from CivicActions tools, files and project after their work is complete. An offboard card template is here: [Offboard: TEMPLATE](https://trello.com/c/sXpzezNI/60-offboard-template)
