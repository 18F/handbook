# Project Team Member Onboarding Process

* Project Manager and Tech Lead shall meet with the new team member before they begin to discuss the project and set expectations. If the new team member is a contractor, the PM and TL interview the contractor for fit in terms of team and work capabilities.
* PM writes a follow up email outlining what was discussed, linking to necessary documents, sharing helpful screenshots, outlining next steps, expectations, etc.
* PM creates a ticket (for the sprint or backlog) to track onboarding process / progress for the new team member.
* The ticket should capture all the steps the new team member needs to take to be onboarded to the project (granting account access, discussing time tracking, getting their SSH key, contractor SoW, inviting them to email lists, explaining balance scores, access to our tools like Slack, etc).
* This ticket should also include notes from the initial meeting call / interview.
* The PM shall provide good examples of properly logged time, ticket management processes, writing an acceptance test and QA steps, etc. These can be screenshots and / or linked Google documents.
* If the new team member is a contractor, the PM shall prepare an "Offboard Card" to ensure the contractor is properly removed from CivicActions tools, files, and project lists after their work is complete. An offboard card template is [here](https://trello.com/c/sXpzezNI/60-offboard-template). See also [Offboarding a Contractor from a Project](offboarding-contractor-from-project.md).
