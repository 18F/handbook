# Offboarding a Contractor from a Project

When offboarding a contractor from a project:

* The Project Manager should use on "Offboard Card" for after their work is completed to ensure they are properly removed from CivicActions tools, files and project. An offboard card template is here: https://trello.com/c/sXpzezNI/60-offboard-template
* You should prepare this card at time of hire so that you have a place to track all tools that they get added.
* Specifically, the Project Manager will need to remove the contractor from:
  * all Google Docs they were added to
  * Trello boards
  * Any misc tools: Slack, Jira, MyBalsamiq, etc.
* The Project Manager should remove the person from any recurring or future calendar invites
* The Project Manager should coordinate the Offboarding ticket with an engineer on the IT/IS board: https://trello.com/b/zgRgVkvs/it-is-infrastructure-support-services to ensure that the remainder of the tasks are completed
* Hold an exit interview with the contractor & send a follow up email with the notes from the interview
