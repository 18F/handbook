# Employment & Harassment Policies

## At-Will Notice

Your employment is At-Will. You are not hired for any definite or specified period of time even though your wages are paid regularly. You are an at-will employee of CivicActions and your employment can be terminated at any time, with or without cause and with or without prior notice. Company policy requires all employees to be hired at-will and this policy cannot be changed by any oral modifications. There have been no implied or verbal agreements or promises to you that you will be discharged only under certain circumstances or after certain procedures are followed. There is no implied employment contract created by this Handbook or any other Company document or written or verbal statement or policy

Only authorized management may alter or modify any of the policies in this Employee Handbook with the exception of the "At-Will Employment" provision, which cannot be altered by anybody. Nothing in this handbook is intended to infringe upon employee rights under Section Seven (7) of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA). See <http://www.nlrb.gov/national-labor-relations-act> if you're curious about it.

## Equal Employment

CivicActions provides equal employment opportunities and administers all aspects and conditions of employment without regard to race, religion, color, gender, sexual orientation, pregnancy, age, national origin, ancestry, physical or mental disability, severe/morbid obesity, medical condition, military or veteran status, genetic information, marital status, ethnicity, alienage or any other protected classification, in accordance with applicable federal, state, and local laws. CivicActions takes allegations of discrimination, intimidation, harassment and retaliation very seriously and will promptly conduct an investigation when warranted.

Equal employment opportunity includes, but is not limited to, employment, training, promotion, demotion, transfer, leaves of absence, and termination.

## Reasonable Accommodations

It is the policy of CivicActions to comply with all the relevant and applicable provisions of the federal Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), as well as state and local laws concerning the employment of persons with disabilities. CivicActions will not discriminate against any qualified employee or job applicant because of a person's physical or mental disability with respect to any terms, privileges, or conditions of employment, including but not limited to hiring, advancement, discharge, compensation, and training.

Employees who become disabled should notify administration if the conditions of the disability impair their ability to perform the essential functions of their position. Where necessary and feasible, reasonable accommodations will be made for qualified disabled employees to perform the essential functions of the job in question, as long as the accommodation does not cause CivicActions undue hardship.

## Exempt v. Non-exempt

Exempt: Employees whose positions meet specific tests established by the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and applicable state law and who are exempt from overtime pay requirements. The basic premise of exempt status is that the exempt employee is to work the hours required to meet his/her work responsibilities. This includes managers and assistant managers as well as designated office personnel.

Non-exempt: Employees whose positions do not meet FLSA and state exemption tests and who are paid a multiple of their regular rate of pay for overtime hours worked.

## Confidentiality

This paragraph is simply intended to alert employees to the need for discretion and is not intended to inhibit normal business communications. For further information, refer to the "Confidential Information and Inventions Agreement" you signed when you were hired.

## Outside Activities

You may engage in outside employment or personal educational activities during non-working hours, provided that such activities do not interfere with your job performance or constitute a conflict of interest.

## Policy Against Proscribed Harassment and Discrimination
_This policy was taken directly from the TriNet handbook as of June 2018._

We are committed to maintaining a respectful, courteous work environment free of unlawful discrimination and harassment, and we are committed to taking all reasonable steps to prevent it and address it. We will not tolerate harassment relating to any characteristic protected under applicable law by any employee, contractor, vendor, customer, or visitor. Protected characteristics include age, race, color, national origin, gender (including pregnancy, childbirth or medical condition related to pregnancy or childbirth), gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, religion, physical or mental disability, medical condition, genetic information, marital status, veteran status, military status, or any other characteristic protected by federal, state, or local law. In addition to any disciplinary action we may take, up to and including termination of employment, offenders may also be personally liable, in the event of litigation, for damages and attorney’s fees and other costs of litigation.
Except where otherwise indicated, the term “harassment," as used in this policy, refers to behavior that is related to any characteristic protected under applicable law and that is personally offensive, intimidating, or hostile, or interferes with work performance, regardless of whether it rises to the level of violating the law. In other words, this policy is stricter than the law, in that this policy defines prohibited harassment more broadly than does the law.

### What is Sexual Harassment?
Under various state and federal laws, sexual harassment includes, but is not limited to, making unwanted sexual advances and requests for sexual favors where:

* Submission to such conduct or communication is either explicitly or implicitly made a term or condition of an individual’s employment; or
* Submission to or rejection of such conduct or communication by an individual is used as a basis for employment decisions affecting such individual; or
* Such conduct or communication has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual’s work performance or creates and/or perpetuates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment.
* As defined by law, sexual harassment can also take the form of other unwelcome conduct or communication that has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual’s work performance or creates and/or perpetuates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment. Such other conduct or communication sometimes takes the form of verbal abuse of a sexual nature, unwanted touching, leering, sexual gestures, a display of sexually suggestive objects or images, sexually explicit or offensive jokes, stories, cartoons, nicknames, slurs, epithets, and other communications of a sexual nature.

### What Are Other Kinds of Harassment?

In addition to sexual harassment, the company prohibits all other harassment based on age, race, color, national origin, gender (including pregnancy, childbirth or medical condition related to pregnancy or childbirth), gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, religion, physical or mental disability, medical condition, genetic information, marital status, veteran status, military status, or any other characteristic protected by federal, state, or local law.

### Forms of Harassment

Harassment may take many forms, including the following conduct when based on the protected characteristics described above:

* Verbal. Epithets; derogatory comments, slurs, or name-calling; inappropriate jokes, emails or any other form of written communication, comments, noises, or remarks; repeated requests for dates, threats, propositions, unwelcome and unwanted correspondence, phone calls, and gifts; or other unwelcome attention.
* Physical. Assault; impeding or blocking movement; physical interference with normal work or movement; unwanted and unwarranted physical contact, such as touching, pinching, patting, grabbing, brushing against, or poking another employee’s body.
* Visual. Abusive or patently offensive images (whether in photographs, posters, cartoons, drawings, paintings or other forms of imagery); displaying abusive or patently offensive images, writings or objects; ogling, staring at or directing attention to an employee’s anatomy; leering; sexually oriented or suggestive gestures.
* Cyberstalking. Proscribed harassment using electronic communication, such as e-mail or instant messaging (IM), or messages posted to a website, blog, or discussion group.

Proscribed harassment can occur in one-on-one interactions or in group settings and can involve a co- worker, manager, vendor, customer, visitor, or agent of the company. Sexual harassment can also occur in the context of a relationship that was once consensual but has changed so that the behavior is no longer welcome by one party. It is impossible to specify every action or all words that could be interpreted as harassment. The examples listed above are not meant to be a complete list of objectionable behavior. Make a point of paying attention to others’ reactions and stated requests and preferences, respecting their wishes, and treating them in a professional manner, regardless of gender, race, religion, nationality, age, sexual orientation, sexual identity or expression, or other protected characteristic.

### Reporting and Investigating Proscribed Harassment

If you believe anyone is harassing you based on a protected characteristic, or harassing another individual in the workplace, we encourage you, if comfortable doing so, to tell the harasser in clear language that the behaviors or advances are unwelcome or unwanted and must stop. The individual may not realize the behavior is objectionable and a simple communication may effectively end the behavior. However, if you are not comfortable engaging in such communication or the behavior does not stop following such communication, you should immediately report your concern to your manager, any other company manager or official, your TriNet HR Representative or the TriNet Solution Center. Report the facts of the incident, including what happened, when, where, how often, and the names of the accused and any witnesses. Managers should immediately report any suspected incidents of harassment of others to a TriNet HR Representative.
All claims of proscribed harassment will be investigated in a timely, objective, and thorough manner as confidentially as possible. All employees are expected to cooperate fully in any investigation. If it is determined that prohibited harassment has occurred, the appropriate corrective action, up to and including termination of employment of the offending employee, will be taken along with any additional steps necessary to prevent further violations of this policy.

### Protection against Retaliation

Neither the company nor the law will tolerate any form of retaliation against any employee who opposes discrimination or prohibited harassment, makes a complaint, or participates in any manner in an internal investigation or an investigation, proceeding, or hearing conducted by a state or federal agency or court. If you believe that you have experienced or witnessed retaliation, you should immediately report your concern to your manager, any other manager or officer, a TriNet HR Representative or the TriNet Solution Center. Any employee who engages in retaliation will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment, as well as possible legal consequences.


## Corrective Action

A high level of job performance and ethical behavior is expected of you.

In the event that your job performance does not meet the standards established for your position, you should seek assistance from your manager to attain an acceptable level of performance. If you fail to respond to or fail to make positive efforts toward improvement, corrective action may ensue.

If you violate established Company procedures, guidelines, or exhibit behavior that violates CivicActions' standards of honesty and integrity or creates an appearance of impropriety, CivicActions may elect to administer disciplinary action.

## Reporting Irregularities

It is the responsibility of each employee of CivicActions to report to a member of the management team any irregularities indicating actual or suspected existence of a loss, fraud, embezzlement or similar impairment of funds or property, or other suspicious activity.

## Conflict of Interest

You know and share the values of our culture here, with an emphasis on integrity and transparency, and conflict of interest will not often be an issue, if ever. But, if you question the propriety of a transaction or activity that involves CivicActions or employees/contractors of CivicActions, or a client, or if an outside activity you may be considering raises questions in your mind, talk to your manager or one of the management team.
