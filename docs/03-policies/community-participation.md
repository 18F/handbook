# Professional Development and Community Participation

## Background - the Why

CivicActions set a goal of developing individual Professional Development plans for all team members in early 2014. We also set a goal of strengthening Community Participation in 2014 and leveraging the intersection of participation and Marketing ([See 5% Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1GuEXsq8m80Sl9Jk2GE_b2oKsk38F11Vc5m7B8M8rGaA/edit#slide=id.g235778c_0_2)).

We value Professional Development and Community Participation for a number of reasons:

- **Professional Development increases your skills which can result in increased revenue opportunities for CivicActions and higher salary for you**

- **Professional Development provides career mobility for each person - increasing our feeling of safety, which leads to:**

  - Having the courage to fail - which leads to experimentation, innovation, and learning
  - Having the courage to challenge the status quo - which leads to organizational learning
  - Having the courage to be vulnerable - which leads to authentic communications and connection
  - Open minded thinking - which leads to increased tolerance of others ideas and personality styles

- **Community Participation provides numerous benefits, including:**

  - Strengthened relationships with experts that can help when we are stuck
  - Career advancement opportunities (potential new employment offers) for each of us, which increases our feeling of safety
  - Opportunities to increase the impact of the work being done by our entire industry - which helps with our mission to transform the way professional services are delivered in government
  - Opportunities for CivicActions to popularize the idea of radical openness, which strengthens our brand

## Logistics and Policy Information

Each team member will meet with their manager or mentor for a Professional Development and Community Participation meeting, at least once a year.

The output of the first meeting will be a Professional Development and Community Participation plan, customized to address individual needs and captured on a Trello board.

  - The stipend will be prorated for team members contracted to work less than full-time (40 hours/week).
  - New team members will have a 3-month (90 day) wait period before becoming eligible for a professional development stipend and it will be earned throughout the first year.

- For conferences or other group events, we may decline time off if more than 20% of the team is requesting to attend and we can't accommodate the project work while so many are out.
- Two (2) months' notice is needed on spends above $300. From time to time we may also cap the total monthly professional development spend across the company, dependent on the budget and cash flow outlook for the month.
