# Travel 101

## Communication

Questions? [Ask Judy](mailto:%3Cjudy.raiten@civicactions.com%3E).

## Billing

Travel time is usually billed to a specific project.

## Expense Approval and Reimbursement

For any project or team onsites, your expenses are almost always reimbursable. Please see [our expense policy](expenses.md) for details on the expense approval and reimbursement process.

## Mileage Reimbursement

CivicActions will reimburse employees at the IRS "business standard mileage rate" for miles traveled by the employee in the employee's car while on CivicActions' business. This reimbursement is meant to cover gas and wear-and-tear on a car. It does not cover tolls or parking, which can be expensed separately.

## Retreat Expenses

Most years, the entire team gathers for an onsite retreat. We gather for 3 days of discussion, planning, and un-conference style sessions. Below you'll find information on logistics and expenses.

### Airfare

You can book your flight or you can request assistance. We ask that you always treat company expenses as if you were the one paying. We have travel days on the Sunday prior to the retreat and the Thursday after.

### Travel to/from airport

You can expense the fare that takes you to and from your home airport. Lyft Line and public transit are encouraged.
We ask that folks arriving and departing the retreat destination coordinate taking public transportation together. We'll have a spreadsheet that will track arrival/departure times to coordinate this. We will also have a retreat slack channel that will be helpful on those days.

### Food

We provide a daily per diem budget of $20/day, with the expectation that you're not paying for breakfast or dinner. We usually choose a hotel that serves an inclusive breakfast and we provide coffee and snacks on location. Lunch is usually done in small groups, where you will likely be buying your own meal and expensing it. We have team dinners that are planned for ahead of time and are paid for by someone who will expense it outside of the per diem. You will be required to use the expense process for any food that you pay for while on retreat.

### Lodging

The hotel is booked in advance and we ask that those who are comfortable doing so share a double room with another team member. We will have a spreadsheet going that is tracking everything and one thing to note on there is whether or not you want to share a room.

### Family

We're in the conference-style sessions all day from 9-5 and then usually do team dinners in the evening, so it's not very family-oriented, but we know that some folks can't leave their families at home. We don't cover airfare for the family members but we do put you in your own hotel room for the nights of the retreat Sunday night through Wednesday night.

### Extended Stay

Some folks have decided to stay longer after the retreat to either cowork with their teams or to take a couple vacation days in a new city. In some cases people invite their families to meet them to enjoy the city together for a long weekend. If you choose to come earlier or stay later the hotel room cost and food costs would be your responsibility.
