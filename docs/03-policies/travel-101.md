# Travel 101

## Communication

Questions? [Ask Judy](mailto:%3Cjudy.raiten@civicactions.com%3E).

## Billing

Travel time is usually billed to a specific project.

## Expense Approval and Reimbursement

For any project or team onsites, your expenses are almost always reimbursable. Please see [our expense policy](expenses.md) for details on the expense approval and reimbursement process. Ensure that expenses you submit do not exceed the allocated stipends or per diems. When logging your expenses in Harvest, make sure to intentionally use the billable label only if the expense is billable back to the client.  

## Mileage Reimbursement

CivicActions will reimburse employees at the IRS "business standard mileage rate" for miles traveled by the employee in the employee's car while on CivicActions' business. This reimbursement is meant to cover gas and wear-and-tear on a car. It does not cover tolls or parking, which can be expensed separately.
