## <a name="trinet"></a>TriNet

CivicActions has a partnership with TriNet, which is a well established Professional Employer Organization. The relationship with TriNet provides us with a selection of benefits that are typically only available to very large organizations. TriNet offers the simplicity of a single solution for outsourcing benefits, payroll, and human resources support. The company's online and in-person services allow customers throughout the United States and Canada to streamline their business, gain enterprise-level resources for managers and employees, and focus on strategy rather than administration. Founded in 1988, TriNet specializes in offering secure, paperless HR transactions to Internet-enabled workforces.

CivicActions has our 401k through SocialK, which provides us with Environment, Social and Governance screened investment options for our retirement plans.

## <a name="equal-opportunities"></a>Equal Employment Opportunities

CivicActions provides equal employment opportunities to "all qualified people". What that means can be found under [Required Stuff](required-stuff.md).

## <a name="background-check"></a>Background Checks

As casual as we are in many areas, CivicActions is a responsible, successful, for-profit business and we do apply some standard business practices. For example, we will almost certainly verify prior employment and check professional references. We may confirm your education before making you an offer. It is also possible that a security check may be required by certain clients from time to time. Third-party services may be hired to perform these checks.

## <a name="immigration-law"></a>Immigration Law Compliance

All CivicActions' employees hired to work in the U.S. need to complete a Form I-9 and produce proof of identity and eligibility to work. These documents will be kept in your confidential electronic personnel file and we will need them as soon as your Employment Agreement is signed.

## <a name="employment-classification"></a>Employment Classifications

CivicActions has established the following Employee Classifications for compensation and benefit purposes only.

Regular Full-Time Employee: An employee who is scheduled to work no less than 40 hours in a work week . The employee is eligible for all employment benefits offered by CivicActions.

Regular Part-Time Employee: An employee who is scheduled to work less than 40 hours in a workweek. Regular part-time employees working at least 30 hours a week are eligible for all employment benefits offered by CivicActions.

Whether an employee is exempt or non-exempt depends on specific, statutory tests. See [Required Stuff](required-stuff.md). For our purposes, exempt employees don't get overtime and non-exempt do.

## <a name="personrecord"></a>Personnel (and Personal) Records

CivicActions will maintain a secure electronic employment file while you remain an employee. This file contains things like I-9s and a copy of I-9 identification, W-4s, and Employment Agreements, and possibly other appropriate documents, on an individual basis. TriNet, as well as our accounting and banking providers, also have secure files which contain information like social security numbers and bank routing information.

If you have any changes to personal information, such as a change of address, phone number or name, we ask that you notify admin so the changes show up in all of your records - and on the Team Roster, in case somebody wants to send you a birthday card.

## <a name="employee-reference"></a>Employee References

CivicActions will only confirm employment and provide employment dates and the positions held in response to third parties inquiries.
