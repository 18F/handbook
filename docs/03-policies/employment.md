## TriNet

CivicActions has a partnership with TriNet, which is a well established Professional Employer Organization. The relationship with TriNet provides us with a selection of benefits that are typically only available to very large organizations. TriNet offers the simplicity of a single solution for outsourcing benefits, payroll, and human resources support. The company's online and in-person services allow customers throughout the United States and Canada to streamline their business, gain enterprise-level resources for managers and employees, and focus on strategy rather than administration. Founded in 1988, TriNet specializes in offering secure, paperless HR transactions to Internet-enabled workforces.

CivicActions has our 401k through SocialK, which provides us with Environment, Social and Governance screened investment options for our retirement plans.

## At-Will Notice

Your employment is At-Will. You are not hired for any definite or specified period of time even though your wages are paid regularly. You are an at-will employee of CivicActions and your employment can be terminated at any time, with or without cause and with or without prior notice. Company policy requires all employees to be hired at-will and this policy cannot be changed by any oral modifications. There have been no implied or verbal agreements or promises to you that you will be discharged only under certain circumstances or after certain procedures are followed. There is no implied employment contract created by this Handbook or any other Company document or written or verbal statement or policy.

Only authorized management may alter or modify any of the policies in this Employee Handbook with the exception of the "At-Will Employment" provision, which cannot be altered by anybody. Nothing in this handbook is intended to infringe upon employee rights under Section Seven (7) of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA). See <http://www.nlrb.gov/national-labor-relations-act> if you're curious about it.

## Equal Employment

<!--- Protected classes from Trinet handbook, keep list updated in: employment, code-of-conduct and anti-harassment-policies -->

CivicActions provides equal employment opportunities and administers all aspects and conditions of employment without regard to age, race, color, national origin, gender (including pregnancy, childbirth or medical condition related to pregnancy or childbirth), gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, religion, physical or mental disability, medical condition, genetic information, marital status, veteran status, military status, or any other characteristic protected by federal, state, or local law. CivicActions takes allegations of discrimination, intimidation, harassment and retaliation very seriously and will promptly conduct an investigation when warranted.

Equal employment opportunity includes, but is not limited to, employment, training, promotion, demotion, transfer, leaves of absence, and termination.

## Reasonable Accommodations

It is the policy of CivicActions to comply with all the relevant and applicable provisions of the federal Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), as well as state and local laws concerning the employment of persons with disabilities. CivicActions will not discriminate against any qualified employee or job applicant because of a person's physical or mental disability with respect to any terms, privileges, or conditions of employment, including but not limited to hiring, advancement, discharge, compensation, and training.

Employees who become disabled should notify administration if the conditions of the disability impair their ability to perform the essential functions of their position. Where necessary and feasible, reasonable accommodations will be made for qualified disabled employees to perform the essential functions of the job in question, as long as the accommodation does not cause CivicActions undue hardship.

## Exempt v. Non-exempt

Exempt: Employees whose positions meet specific tests established by the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and applicable state law and who are exempt from overtime pay requirements. The basic premise of exempt status is that the exempt employee is to work the hours required to meet his/her work responsibilities. This includes managers and assistant managers as well as designated office personnel.

Non-exempt: Employees whose positions do not meet FLSA and state exemption tests and who are paid a multiple of their regular rate of pay for overtime hours worked.

## Confidentiality

This paragraph is simply intended to alert employees to the need for discretion and is not intended to inhibit normal business communications. For further information, refer to the "Confidential Information and Inventions Agreement" you signed when you were hired.

## Outside Activities

You may engage in outside employment or personal educational activities during non-working hours, provided that such activities do not interfere with your job performance or constitute a conflict of interest.

## Corrective Action

A high level of job performance and ethical behavior is expected of you.

In the event that your job performance does not meet the standards established for your position, you should seek assistance from your manager to attain an acceptable level of performance. If you fail to respond to or fail to make positive efforts toward improvement, corrective action may ensue.

If you violate established Company procedures, guidelines, or exhibit behavior that violates CivicActions' standards of honesty and integrity or creates an appearance of impropriety, CivicActions may elect to administer disciplinary action.

## Reporting Irregularities

It is the responsibility of each employee of CivicActions to report to a member of the management team any irregularities indicating actual or suspected existence of a loss, fraud, embezzlement or similar impairment of funds or property, or other suspicious activity.

## Conflict of Interest

You know and share the values of our culture here, with an emphasis on integrity and transparency, and conflict of interest will not often be an issue, if ever. But, if you question the propriety of a transaction or activity that involves CivicActions or employees/contractors of CivicActions, or a client, or if an outside activity you may be considering raises questions in your mind, talk to your manager or one of the management team. See the full [Conflict of Interest Plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JSvThcqIM8BSmIoAjUrNZPdx0wemMCiyrBRyChORfv0/edit) for more information.

## Background Checks

As casual as we are in many areas, CivicActions is a responsible, successful, for-profit business and we do apply some standard business practices. For example, we will almost certainly verify prior employment and check professional references. We may confirm your education before making you an offer. It is also possible that a security check may be required by certain clients from time to time. Third-party services may be hired to perform these checks.

## Immigration Law Compliance

All CivicActions' employees hired to work in the U.S. need to complete a Form I-9 and produce proof of identity and eligibility to work. These documents will be kept in your confidential electronic personnel file and we will need them as soon as your Employment Agreement is signed.

## Employment Classifications

CivicActions has established the following Employee Classifications for compensation and benefit purposes only.

Regular Full-Time Employee: An employee who is scheduled to work no less than 40 hours in a work week . The employee is eligible for all employment benefits offered by CivicActions.

Regular Part-Time Employee: An employee who is scheduled to work less than 40 hours in a workweek. Regular part-time employees working at least 30 hours a week are eligible for all employment benefits offered by CivicActions.

Whether an employee is exempt or non-exempt depends on specific, statutory tests. See [Anti Harassment Policies](anti-harassment-policies.md). For our purposes, exempt employees don't get overtime and non-exempt do.

## Personnel (and Personal) Records

CivicActions will maintain a secure electronic employment file while you remain an employee. This file contains things like I-9s and a copy of I-9 identification, W-4s, and Employment Agreements, and possibly other appropriate documents, on an individual basis. TriNet, as well as our accounting and banking providers, also have secure files which contain information like social security numbers and bank routing information.

If you have any changes to personal information, such as a change of address, phone number or name, we ask that you notify the People Operations Manager or Office Manager so the changes show up in all of your records.

## Employee References

CivicActions will only confirm employment and provide employment dates and the positions held in response to third parties inquiries.
