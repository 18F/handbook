## Substance Abuse Policy

CivicActions ("Company") is committed to providing a drug-free work environment. The use of drugs and abuse of alcohol not only jeopardizes the health, safety, and well-being of the individual user and coworkers, it also results in increased absenteeism and decreased productivity, higher workers' compensation costs and health/disability premiums, and endangers the safety of the general public.

### PURPOSE
Our employees are our most valuable resource, and the safety of our employees and the public is important to us. The Company developed and published this substance abuse policy to address this very difficult health and social problem. This policy is intended to accurately detect and deter the use and abuse of drugs and alcohol in the workplace, while respecting the dignity and privacy of our employees. This policy replaces all existing policies concerning substance abuse and drug testing of employees.

### POLICY GUIDELINES

It is the policy of the Company that the possession, sale, or use of illegal drugs is inconsistent with the Company's needs to operate in a safe and efficient manner. The Company is also required by contract with most of our federal and state clients to require a drug free workplace environment. In some instances our contractual obligations may prohibit activities in the workplace or while performing work that may otherwise be legal. Although we are a work from home company, employees should be aware that the restrictions apply any place the performance of work is done in connection with their employment. 

For that reason:

1. The use of unlawful drugs is prohibited in the workplace or during the performance of work. "Unlawful drugs" are defined as any drug that cannot be obtained legally in the United States or has been illegally obtained, including prescription drugs obtained without a prescription, prescribed or over-the-counter drugs used other than as properly instructed, and drugs deemed illegal. This policy also prohibits employees from drug use that impairs their performance on the job, as well as prohibiting use while on Company business at any time, whether on Company property or off. In addition, involvement with unlawful drugs, including their manufacture and distribution, constitutes unacceptable conduct and is prohibited.
2. Employees are prohibited from bringing prescription drugs on Company property unless they have been prescribed to the employee for a current condition by a licensed physician. Such drugs may be utilized only by employees receiving such prescriptions in the manner, combination, and quantity prescribed. In the event that an employee is taking a prescribed medication that may impair his or her ability to perform his/her position, the employee must give his or her supervisor advance notice. Employees may not use prescription drugs that are illegal under federal or state law while on Company business at any time, whether on Company property or off.
3. Employees are prohibited from being under the impairment of alcohol or the influence of drugs while on Company business at any time, whether on Company property or off. Employees also are prohibited from consuming alcoholic beverages during work hours. The only exception to this provision will apply to moderate consumption and/or possession of alcohol at Company-approved functions.
4. The Company does not prohibit employees from engaging in legal conduct outside the workplace during non work hours.
5. Employees must disclose any conviction—including a plea, finding of guilty, a plea of "nolo contendere," and/or imposition of a fine, jail sentence, or other penalty—for a drug-related offense in the workplace to the Company within five (5) days after such conviction.
6. Violation of any portion of this policy may subject the employee to appropriate disciplinary measures, up to and including termination.
7. On company owned or provided facilities the Company reserves the right to search employees, visitors, lockers, personal effects, cars, and work areas. The Company does not intend to implement such searches in an arbitrary or indiscriminate manner.
8. Any employee who feels that he or she may have a substance abuse problem is urged to contact his or her supervisor or a representative of the Company's employee assistance program (EAP). Such an employee will not be disciplined or retaliated against for such contact; however, contacting one's supervisor after an incident will not immunize an employee from otherwise appropriate disciplinary action.
9. Employees who are disciplined for substance abuse may appeal the discipline under the relevant employee manual policies.
10. The Company reserves the right to modify, amend, or revoke this substance abuse policy. Employees will be notified if any changes are made.
11. A copy of this substance abuse policy will be provided to every person hired by the Company, to any person offered conditional employment, and upon request to any job applicant. Its receipt and acknowledgment by each employee or conditional employee is required. An employee who has questions or concerns about this policy should contact the Director for Professional Services.
