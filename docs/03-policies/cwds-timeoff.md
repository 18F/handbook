# CWDS Team: Request Time Off Procedure

Should you need time off (sick, personal, vacation), there is a procedure to follow that helps ensure your request is efficient & transparent to your team. With all requests, the more advanced notice you can provide the better. 

## Personal & Vacation Time Off

1. Before you request off time, think about a plan for project coverage, which also includes a plan for making up as many project hours as possible per the contract.
2. Speak with the DevOps Service Manager as soon as you know you need time off & have your plans ready. Request the dates verbally, and explain your plan for getting project coverage. It is not acceptable to request time off when you are the on-call support for the team.
3. Speak with your fellow team members to ensure they agree to cover your workload while you are out.
4. Send an email to the entire DevOps team (all team members, service manager, scrum master, product manager) that lists the dates you will be out and explains your plan for getting your work covered and ensuring the project will not be at risk in your absence.
5. Add your out of office dates to the DevOps calendar on SharePoint. 
6. Lastly, follow [CivicActionsâ€™ policy for requesting off time](../03-policies/benefits.md), and explain your plans and hours. This is a required step to ensure transparency between all teams:
    * Email ca-timeoff@lists.civicactions.net requesting the time and explain your plan for coverage as discussed with DevOps Service Manager, Scrum Master, & DevOps team.
    * When the time off is approved, your CivicActions manager will simply "reply-all" to your original email and add it to CivicActions Forecast tool. 
    * Then the CivicActions admin will put it on the master CivicActions calendar.
    * Follow the procedure for [logging time off](../04-how-we-work/tools/harvest.md) in Harvest with CivicActions.


## Sick Time Off

1. As soon as you know you will not make it to work, send an email to the entire DevOps team (all team members, service manager, scrum master, product manager) that explains you are ill and how long you think you will need off to recover.
2. Include in your email the tasks you had planned for that day and what the team should do with them to ensure project success.
3. When possible, include a plan for making up as many project hours as possible per the contract.
4. Then also email ca-timeoff@lists.civicactions.net explaining your plans and hours you will be out. This is a required step to ensure transparency between all teams. 
5. Lastly, follow the procedure for [logging sick time off](../04-how-we-work/tools/harvest.md) in Harvest with CivicActions.
