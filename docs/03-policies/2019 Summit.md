## What is the CivicActions Annual Summit?
Once a year CivicActions gathers all members of our remote team together for a week of visioning, coworking and bonding. The annual summit is an opportunity to get to know one another more deeply, and to organize around a larger common purpose. 

### Past summit locations
*   2018 Boulder, CO
*   2017 Sacramento, CA
*   2016 Las Vegas, NV
*   2015 New Orleans, LA

## Context, Purpose, and Results (CPR) 
We use the CPR framework to collaboratively shape the time we spend together at the Summit. The team starts by brainstorming the results we want to see, which we use to articulate the purpose that drives our activities. Finally, we come up with one word that sets the context for our conversations together. 

Watch the [All Hands Call recording](https://zoom.us/recording/share/sOrrkUI_O-J9Y6XjOJWYPi-P0wWbAetBt6SCxLZxICKwIumekTziMw) on using CPR to set context for the Summit

### Context
The context for the 2019 Summit is Alignment.

### Purpose
The purpose of the 2019 CivicActions Summit is to deepen our alignment, strengthen our practices, generate new ideas, expand our knowledge, and joyously celebrate our experience of being together.

## Policies

### Follow the code of conduct
Everyone who attends the Summit is expected to [read and follow our Code of Conduct](https://civicactions-handbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/03-policies/code-of-conduct/). 

### Keep the Summit a safe place for everyone
The Summit is a harassment-free event. More on the [Policy Against Proscribed Harassment and Discrimination](https://civicactions-handbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/03-policies/anti-harassment-policies/).

### Don’t do drugs at the Summit
No illegal drugs are permitted in the workplace. Reminder that marijuana is still illegal under federal law.

### Be mindful of your alcohol consumption
It is not tolerated to be under the influence in the workplace. The exception is that moderate drinking at company dinners is permitted.

### Dress how you’re most comfortable
Dress however you are comfortable. For example, some folks are most comfortable in a button-up with khakis; others prefer casual jeans and t-shirts. 

We are planning to take coworking photos throughout the Summit that may show up on the internet (with your consent of course), so consider that with your attire choices. Remember to bring your CivicActions T-Shirt for the team photo.

### Ask before hugging
Be mindful of personal space -- note that not all of your coworkers are comfortable with hugs, you can always ask them with a smile, "are you a hugger?" and offer your hand as your greeting.

### Photos
Sharing photos
You can share photos from the Summit in our [google photos album](https://photos.app.goo.gl/6KPr3CGxmWGHz8DE6).

#### Taking photos for personal use
If you’re taking photos that you intend to post on your personal online accounts, it’s polite to get consent from the people in the photo (usually easiest to do this when you take it).

#### Your privacy preferences
If you’ve already let CivicActions know that you don’t want your photo posted on CivicActions accounts in certain circumstances (or all circumstances), that policy will continue to apply to all the photos we take at the retreat — so don’t worry. We’ve got you covered.

#### Volunteer to help
We’re looking for volunteers to participate in a few staged images for our website that help tell the story of how we work. Reach out to Kauff-e if you’d like to help.
