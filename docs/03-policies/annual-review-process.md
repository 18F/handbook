# Annual Review Process

In our annual review process, you'll ask people you work with closely to give you feedback. This feedback goes only to you, and a time will be scheduled for you to discuss this feedback and otherwise reflect on your previous year and think about the upcoming year.

The template to send your colleagues looks like this, and you can personalize it if you'd like:

Hi *Colleague*,

It's time for my annual review and I'd like to request feedback from you since we have worked closely together. The info you share with me won't be shared directly with anyone but me, so please be as honest and direct as you can be. Below are the areas that I'm looking for feedback on and I need this returned to me by *Day before your scheduled review with your manager*:

Communication (client, team)
Balance management
Supporting team members
Managing my time and my work (scheduling, estimates, prioritisation, etc.)
The Work (project work, technical work, internal work, etc.)
Professional Development (skills, self improvement, knowledge, etc.)

Thanks!
