## Policy

### Time Off for Coronavirus

Anyone who is taking time off that is related to the coronavirus (illness or caring for others, including childcare) should follow these guidelines.

1. Email ca-schedule if your availability drops or you have a shift in schedule
2. If this is a regular event (e.g. daily childcare), block it out in your calendar and make it "public" which allows other CivicActioners to see it.
3. Communicate with your team and PO about your availability and discuss impact.
4. Use slack status to indicate when you are offline during regular working hours.
5. In Harvest, log time off to "\[CA\]: Coronavirus Timeoff". You can choose the "task" of "care for others" or "care for self".
6. If you are doing community service work please log that under "CivicActions: Community Participation" in Harvest. (We encourage everyone who can to contribute 2 hours a week back to your community)

### Coverage Plans

We have asked that projects and key individuals put together coverage plans to identify responsibilities and to avoid any single point of failure, in the event that they are unexpectedly out of office. Not everyone will have access to the links below but if you are on the project or are a backup person, you will have access to the documentation that affects you.

- [Individual Plans](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1eGcBDhewLEJvhrjtnBW286_AmVaJDKin?usp=sharing)
- Project Plans are in project folders.

### Cancellation of non-critical meetings

CivicActions is cancelling any non-critical meetings through March. After March, those meetings are all optional. During this period, we are attempting to make space for those who have family members at home and also for projects that may have teammates less available. Our intention is to give the majority of our focus to our project work and a new initiative to move the government towards distributed work. We are looking for ways for people to feel some spaciousness without feeling isolation, so if you need connections beyond your project work, please ensure you're getting them by reaching out to your pod channel, manager or check-in person for support. The list of meetings can be found in the slack [announcement](https://civicactions.slack.com/archives/C02FG74LE/p1584379986057100).

### Coronavirus Family First Response Act

The Federal Government has enacted the [Families First Coronavirus Response Act](https://www.trinet.com/insights/families-first-coronavirus-response-act-what-it-means-for-your-small-and-medium-size-business), a plan aimed at addressing the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on Americans and introducing paid sick leave and an expanded family and medical leave act to the nation's employers.

The most noticeable impact for CivicActions is that we have created a Coronavirus Time Off category in Harvest. If you take time off related to coronavirus you should record the time off under one of the two categories for Coronavirus Time Off.

If you are experiencing or expecting a significant impact on your ability to work, please reach out to Elizabeth or a member of the People Ops team, so we can figure out how we might be able to support you.

- Most people who get sick with COVID-19 will have only mild illness and should recover at home. Older adults and people of any age with certain serious underlying medical conditions should seek care as soon as symptoms start. \
  Care at home can help stop the spread of COVID-19 and help protect people who are at risk for getting seriously ill from COVID-19. \

## Balance

- Prioritize your health and family health. By doing so you are contributing to flattening the curve reducing the stress on our health care system.
- We encourage everyone who is able to do safely to give back up to two hours per week for community service. If you are in a high risk group, look for opportunities to contribute remotely or safely.
- It is okay to have kids with you on calls or in the room. By default children are welcome to attend calls.
- Block off times in your day to attend to caregiving for others including helping or conducting homeschooling activities. Please make sure to record this time in your Harvest timesheet.
- If your local community guidelines allow it, take walks outside with your family. You can do this before or after work, or if it works for your family adjust your schedule to do it during the day.
- Adjust your daily routine to accommodate that you may have more people home all day. You may want to consider adjusting your schedule to allow you to have lunch with your family everyday. It is okay to ask others to reschedule meetings to let you do this.
- Be flexible in supporting others you might need to adjust their work schedule or ask to change the times of regular meetings to accommodate changes in their life outside of work.
- Consider managing your social media usage and news intake, especially if you find it increases stress levels.
