# How and when to contribute to the handbook

This handbook is written by and for all employees of CivicActions. Everyone is encouraged to contribute to continuously improve it.

The most common incentive to create or edit documentation is to "scratch an itch" that's felt when we come across a lack of information, or lack of standards around a practice. If you find a hole in the documentation, you're probably the best person to take a stab at filling it.

We also have [a Trello board](https://trello.com/b/ZKx6l4bC/civicactions-documentation-project) to manage the documentation backlog. Feel free to pick something off the backlog to work on.

The documentation working group currently meets weekly to prioritize backlog items as they come up.

We also use the [#docs](https://civicactions.slack.com/messages/docs/) channel in Slack to communicate throughout the week.

## Minimal Viable Contribution

Better than doing nothing at all:

- [Open a Trello card](https://trello.com/b/ZKx6l4bC/civicactions-documentation-project) with a documentation suggestion, or
- chat about it in [#docs](https://civicactions.slack.com/messages/docs/).

## Writing documentation

You should read the rest of this 00-contributing section if you intend to contribute beyond just a Trello ticket or chatting in the #docs channel.
