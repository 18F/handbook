Most of GSA&rsquo;s internal tools are accessible via our Agency&rsquo;s intranet [Insite](http://insite.gsa.gov). You must be on the VPN to connect if you work remotely. [Instructions for connecting are here](/networks/). Here&rsquo;s an overview of what you can access (you can click the names in this table to scroll down the page):

### Browser requirements

Please note that while many of these websites work fine in Chrome or Firefox, you *must* use Safari or Internet Explorer to access ALOHA and Online University.

Let&rsquo;s cover each of these tools in a bit more detail.


## <a id="aloha">ALOHA</a>

<a href="http://aloha.gsa.gov/">ALOHA</a> is what you'll use to request and document leave (sick, annual, bereavement, and more).

In general, you should request leave ahead of time (although it is possible to request leave retroactively) and document any absences as soon as possible. If you&rsquo;re planning to take leave, please ask your project team(s) as well as your director or direct supervisor if it&rsquo;s okay. Once you get your supervisor's approval, sign in to ALOHA and submit your leave request (select your direct supervisor from the drop-down menu).

After you've created your leave request, add your planned absence to the shared Google calendar &ldquo;18F Out of Office&rdquo; &mdash; that way, everyone will know when you&rsquo;re going to be out of the office.

We also ask that you update your Slack profile so that your name reads _FirstName LastName OOO (1/1 - 1/5)_ so that it's apparent, at a glance, that you're not at work.  Finally, please note that ALOHA is GSA&rsquo;s system and separate from Tock, which is 18F&rsquo;s own timekeeping system. If you&rsquo;re taking time off, you&rsquo;ll need to make sure you&rsquo;re accounted for in both.

Please do not use ALOHA to document jury duty. If you&rsquo;ve been summoned for jury duty, [email (don't Slack) Leah Gitter](mailto:leah.gitter@gsa.gov) and add an event to the &ldquo;18F Out of Office&rdquo; calendar.

Some remote employees have had difficulty accessing ALOHA. If you&rsquo;re one of them, please [ping Leah Gitter on Slack](https://18f.slack.com/messages/leahgitter/) with the dates you took (or need to take) leave and the type of leave you took. Leah will make sure to get your request logged.

You can see your remaining leave balances by clicking Create My Leave Request. You do not have to submit a request in order to view your available leave time. You can also see your leave balance on your paystub in [Employee Express](#employee-express).


## <a id="bookit">BookIt!</a>

[BookIt!](https://bookit.gsa.gov/mobile/auth/spnego/spnegoLogin.jsp) is what you'll use to reserve a desk or a meeting room within a GSA building.

Here are some tips for employees that frequent an office:

<ul>
  <li>
    To periodically reserve a workstation in D.C.:
    <ol>
      <li>Go to `Profile → View Your Profile → Edit Profile`. </li>
      <li> Go to <code>Profile --> View your Profile --> Edit Profile </code> </li>
      <li>Pick the workstation you'd like to reserve each day. 18F is on floor 4, wing 4.</li>
      <li>Type: Workstation, Room Name: 4461A-Z</li>
      <li>Choose the day of the week (today)</li>
      <li>Choose start and end times (typically, 9am and 6pm)</li>
      <li>Click save</li>
    </ol>
    Once your one-click settings are set up, you only have to hit two buttons each day: One-Click and Express Check-In (the top button on the left — arrow into door)
  </li>
  <li>BookIT! can remember your office location so you won't have to scroll through drop-down menus every time you need to reserve a meeting room. To save your office location settings, go to <code>Profile → View Your Profile → Edit Profile.</code></li>
  <li>BookIT! can remember your office location so you won't have to scroll through drop-down menus every time you need to reserve a meeting room. To save your office location settings, go to <code>Profile → View Your Profile → Edit Profile</code>.</li>
  <li>BookIT! also allows you to add &ldquo;delegates,&rdquo; or people who can book rooms and/or check in on your behalf. To do that, go to <code>Profile → View Your Profile → Delegates → Edit Profile</code>.</li>
  <li>Some employees have expressed difficulty in logging into BookIT! If you&rsquo;re having difficulty, try bookmarking <a href="https://bookit.gsa.gov/mobile/auth/spnego/spnegoLogin.jsp">the BookIT! login page</a>. It should immediately ask for your ENT password. In DC, you can also email <a href="mailto:1800ftenantsupport@gsa.gov">1800tenantsupport@gsa.gov</a> and ask to be added to the 18F org they should be able to add you to the list in a day.</li>
 </ul>

## <a id="chris">CHRIS</a>

[CHRIS](http://www.gsa.gov/chris) is what you'll use to access your personnel file online, which includes your salary, your GS level, your supervisor, your past performance rating(s), and information about health insurance plan, for starters. Some people feel CHRIS is easier to use than Employee Express.

Your account may not be set up by the time you start working at 18F. Account setup and activation are usually complete within a month of your start date; you'll receive an email from CHRIS once your account is set up and activated. If you don't receive this email within a month of starting, open a ticket with the [GSA IT Service Desk](https://gsa.service-now.com/GSA_Self-Service/).


## <a id="concur">Concur</a>

Concur is what you will use to book travel. Learn more in [Travel 101](/travel-101). If you have questions in the meantime, head over to [#travel](https://18f.slack.com/messages/travel/).


## <a id="employee-express">Employee Express</a>

[Employee Express](https://www.employeeexpress.gov/) is used to view your paystub, change your withholdings, change your health insurance plan, and change your address.

If you&rsquo;re new to GSA, it&rsquo;ll take a few weeks for IT to set up your account. (You should have access after your first paycheck.) You’ll receive a `Welcome to Employee Express` email with a security code.

1. You **must** click the first link first to activate your account.
2. Sign in with your temporary ID number (last five digits of your social security number).
3. After you activate your account, you can set up your login ID and password.
4. Then, go back to the welcome email and click the second link to log in.

Once your account is setup, be sure to log in right away as that initial access expires within a few days. If you have trouble logging in, call the Employee Express help desk at 1-888-353-9450 or email [eexhelp@opm.gov](mailto:eexhelp@opm.gov). They&rsquo;ll ask you for your name, date of birth, agency (OCSIT/18F), work email address, and request type (for example, `my SSN is not recognized` or `I need my login and password reset`).

If they ask for your health insurance code, you can see that in CHRIS under `GSA Personnel → Self Service → Employee Views → Benefits → Health Plan`. Your code is the number next to your health plan.

See [Benefits](/benefits) for more details about Employee Express.

## <a id="it-service-desk">IT Service Desk</a>

If you have any issues with a GSA-maintained system or website, you'll need to contact the IT service desk. Their chat feature is the most convenient way to get in touch with them. To contact the IT Service Desk via chat, visit the [GSA IT Service Desk](https://gsa.service-now.com/GSA_Self-Service/). Go to `Get Help → Contact the Service Desk → Live Chat` (Under the &ldquo;GSA IT Service Desk&rdquo; heading). If you need to submit a ticket, please choose Patrick Bateman from the Supervisor dropdown (most easily findable by typing `patrick.bateman`). He'll respond to any supervisor signoffs quickly.

If you need to reset your ENT password, you can let your password expire and then change it through the Mac popup window. This will not cause you any issues. And if you're on a Mac and change your ENT password, once you log out and log back in, make sure you're on the GSA-wireless network (_not_ GSA-guest) so that you can re-authenticate.


## <a id="meeting-space">Meeting Space</a>

<a href="https://meet.gsa.gov/">Meeting Space</a> is the service you'll use to create your own conference call line. Here&rsquo;s how to do that:

1. Log in. Click `Meetings → New Meeting`.
2. Fill out the required fields on the `Meeting Information` form and accept the defaults for everything else. Essentially, you're setting up a fake meeting to trigger a request for a conference line.
3. After you set up the meeting, an &ldquo;audio profile&rdquo; is automatically generated for you.
4. Wait up to eight days. Audio profiles are created in weekly batches, so it can take up to seven or eight days before yours is created. Please note that you won't receive a notification once your profile is created — be sure to log in to check on the status of your profile.
5. Log in. Click `Meetings → New Meeting`.
6. On the Enter &ldquo;Meeting Information page,&rdquo; scroll down to Audio Conference Settings and click Manage Audio Profiles. You should see a table on the left-hand side of the screen that lists an audio profile (with a name along the lines of GSA Meeting Space Audio Profile).
7. If the table is empty, your profile hasn't been created yet. Otherwise, click the audio profile name to see your conference line number and passcodes.

While this process can take up to eight days, the upshot is that your conference number is permanent! Yours to keep, forever.

## <a id="online-university">Online University</a>

[Online University (OLU)](https://gsaolu.gsa.gov/) is where you'll take mandatory trainings for federal employees.

To register for OLU, navigate to https://gsaolu.gsa.gov. You'll need to be on a GSA network to reach it. Then
follow the link, "Need help logging in to OLU..."

![OLU front page](/images/olu/olu1.png)

From the "Alternative Support Options" drop-down menu, select "Request GSA Online University Login"

![OLU Alt support](/images/olu/olu2.png)

Finally, complete the form, submit and await your temporary password and further
instructions by email.

![OLU registration form](/images/olu/olu3.png)

18F employees are required to take the [following courses](/professional-development-and-training/#mandatory-training).

Note that there is a lag time of about four days between completing courses in OLU and having those courses reflected in your CHRIS profile.

You can log time spent in OLU as `Training / Professional Development` in [Tock](/tock).


## Office supplies

18F also has an inventory of computer supplies on hand. Contact [Matt Spencer](https://18f.slack.com/messages/@mattspencer/) to see if we have anything on hand before putting in a purchase request. If you are remote, we’ll mail your mouse or computer to you.

Access to general office supplies varies based on your location — see our [office tour guides](/offices). The D.C. office has a supply center on the first floor of the GSA building. The supply center offers paper, pens, notebooks, and other basic office supplies (many of which can also be found in printer rooms throughout the building). If you need office supplies that aren't available in the printer rooms or the supply center, you'll need to complete a [purchase request form](https://docs.google.com/a/gsa.gov/forms/d/1zSuFinxBVr0oi2aGFaHArRJ8McyfQhjC05SOGuCzo/viewform). [Kathryn Connolly](https://18f.slack.com/messages/@kathryn/) can tell you more about the form.

For software requests, see our [equipment guide](/equipment/#requests).

## Transit benefits

All GSA employees who take mass/public transit to work are eligible for transit subsidies. To receive a transit subsidy, you&rsquo;ll need to fill out [GSA form 3675](http://www.gsa.gov/portal/forms/download/115174) and get your supervisor&rsquo;s signature. Use `OCSIT (X)` or `XF` as your organizational code. Instructions differ slightly for each office location; see our [office tour guides](/offices) for more information.

GSA's new Point of Contact for the transit subsidy program (CommuterConnections) is CO Transit Subsidy: [co-transit-subsidy@gsa.gov](mailto:co-transit-subsidy@gsa.gov).
