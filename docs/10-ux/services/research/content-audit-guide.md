# Content Audit Guide

## What it is:

A content audit is the activity of checking all of the content on an existing website, and compiling it into a big list (usually in a spreadsheet). There are two kinds of audits: _quantitative inventories_ and _qualitative assessments_. The inventory answers the question "What content is there?" and the assessment answers the question "Is it any good?"

## How to do it:

- Quantitative inventory: For each piece of content, an inventory generally lists a:
  - title,
  - format (standard text, video, PDF, etc.),
  - URL or other location,
  - content type (landing page, article, support page, contact page, etc.), and
  - "owner" (person responsible for upkeep)
  - When working on a Drupal site, it is helpful to conduct an inventory of existing content types, fields in each content type, and number of nodes for each content type
- Qualitative assessment: ask the following questions (from Erin Kissane, "The Elements of Content Strategy") when evaluating content:
  - Is it appropriate?
  - Useful and user-centered?
  - Clear, consistent, and concise?
  - Has it been properly supported, or is it outdated or inaccurate?

See Recommended Reading below for more detailed information about possible approaches.

## Why to do it:

A content audit is the best way to fully comprehend all existing content and to accurately access current content woes and assets.

Specifically, a content audit and analysis helps us understand:

- How is content currently performing?
- How do users currently view a given agency or department based on viewing their existing website?
- What is the tone, voice and branding for the agency?
- What is the lifecycle history of content?
