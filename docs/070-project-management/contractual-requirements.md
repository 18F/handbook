# Tracking Contractual Requirements

The project manager is the main team member responsible for ensuring the team stays on track for completing all the contractual and agreed upon deliverables. The PM should work closely with the tech lead and product owner to make sure contractual deliverables are being considered in sprint planning and completed by the agreed upon due dates. It is the PM's responsibility to be transparent with the PO and team if risks arise relating to the completion of contractual deliverables (to be tracked in a risk ledger).

The PM should have a method for tracking these deliverables (such as a spreadsheet in the client project folder) that includes (but is not limited to) the following:

- Task ID number (such as PWS number from the contract)
- Deliverable name
- Deliverable description
- Due date
- Status of deliverable (to do, in progress, ongoing monthly, delivered, accepted)
- Submission date of deliverable
- Link to Jira ticket (if applicable)
- Deliverable owner/lead (if applicable)
- Cost associated with deliverable (if applicable)
