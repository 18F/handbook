# Writing style

## Tone

This will be fleshed out in future iterations. For now, keep in mind that content appearing in the handbook should be welcoming, personable, and free from jargon.

## Suggestions

The [Gitlab CI build](gitlab-ci.md) outputs a list of suggestions to improve the readbility, language and grammar of the file(s) your pull requests touches. You are encouraged to review and incorporate these.

## Specific terms

- Never refer to "Open Source" Software without specifying it Free/Libre Open Source Software, which can be shorted to FLOSS. See [Richard Stallman's explanation](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/floss-and-foss.en.html) if you want to know more.
