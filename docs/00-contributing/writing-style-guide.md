# Writing style

## Tone

This will be fleshed out in future iterations. For now, keep in mind that content appearing in the handbook should be welcoming, personable, and free from jargon.

## Retext

In the past, we used [retext](https://github.com/wooorm/retext/), which gave warnings (but did not fail Travis CI builds) for language that looks possibly incorrect, overly complex or insensitive. The warnings were too numerous to be useful, but we may want to reenable retext in the gulp file, after tweaking the settings at [.retext.js](https://github.com/CivicActions/handbook/blob/master/.retext.js)

## Specific terms

- Never refer to "Open Source" Software without specifying it Free/Libre Open Source Software, which can be shorted to FLOSS. See [Richard Stallman's explanation](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/floss-and-foss.en.html) if you want to know more.
