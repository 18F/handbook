# Documentation Governance

Every team member is empowered to make pull requests with changes to any part of the documentation, and every team member is empowered to review and approve those pull requests.  

However, we want to encourage ownership of sections of the documentation by those who know the topics best. In some cases that may be an individual, but in most cases, that ownership is related to a practice area or working group within the company.  

Ideally, pull requests should be assigned to team members involved in whatever practice area the documentation relates to. For example, changes to the LICENSE.md file were assigned to our lawyer (who happens to be a copyleft and FLOSS expert).  If you're not sure who to assign the PR too, you might want to ask in the #docs channel.

You can learn more about pull requests in [git-workflow.md](git-workflow.md).

This governance doc will likely be expanded as we formalize some of the practice areas within the company.
