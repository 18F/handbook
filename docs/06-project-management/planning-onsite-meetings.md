# Planning Travel and Onsite Meetings

We sometimes meet with clients "onsite," in their offices or elsewhere, to conduct sales meetings, discovery research and/or product demos and evaluation during the development process. Anytime travel is involved, use the [CivicActions Travel Details form](https://docs.google.com/a/civicactions.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSft4CpmAI0lbwnhm0AuMyPD2XTJdmrACxo6OvebNQp5ele7SA/viewform) as a starting point for your planning (this helps Judy with coordination). Do as much planning as is appropriate for your specific project.

## Onsite Planning Guidelines

* Create a Trello board for keeping track of all the details: lodging, meals, transportation, prep tasks, etc. See [TEMPLATE: Onsite Meeting Planning](https://trello.com/b/bAaDzP0s/template-onsite-meeting-planning).
* Create a budget for the onsite meeting period.
* Create a dedicated calendar for scheduling onsite meetings and invite participants.
* Research hotels and coordinate booking details with Judy.
* Remind CivicActions participants to coordinate with Judy to book flights.
* Research meal options and coordinate with Judy on food orders, delivery, and reservations.
* [TEMPLATE: Discovery](https://trello.com/b/TtMYHp1i/template-discovery), which includes a backlog of potential onsite discovery activities, may be a useful guide if your onsite meetings are Discovery-related.
