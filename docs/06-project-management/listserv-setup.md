# Listserv Setup

We use internal and client-facing listservs for email communication. PMs are  responsible for setting up and maintaining project mailing lists.

## Naming conventions

* project@lists.civicactions.net (includes clients)
* project-int@lists.civicactions.net (just for CivicActions staff)

## Create new project email list

* [Login](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K2wJEHaU6sEXNPY3DGzcHTiNW0dI6PD7bPyRYmKxiKE/edit)
* Select *New Mailing List*
* Create lists (project & project-int)
* Locate list in the big listing directory
* Select *Add Subscriber* (column 1) to add people to the new lists (do this for both lists)

## Add person to existing list

* [Login](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K2wJEHaU6sEXNPY3DGzcHTiNW0dI6PD7bPyRYmKxiKE/edit)
* Select *Mailing Lists*
* Review *Show Subscriber* (column 3) to check that user doesn't already exist on list
* Then *Add Subscriber* (column 1) to add person to list
* Ask the client/Product Owner if they have anyone else in their office who should be on the client-facing mailing list
