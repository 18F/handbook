# CivicActions Bio Instructions

Now that you're part of the team, we want to add your photo and bio to our team page!

## Process

1. Manager will introduce you to Copy Writer/Editor 
2. Review this [template](https://docs.google.com/a/civicactions.net/document/d/130qr5b3pCw6tf9-V9tDxYfm2qfU1flQWwL2M5X76yIk/edit?usp=sharing)
3. Make a COPY of the template
4. Make doc accessible for all folks in the organization to see or share it directly with appropriate folks (Alaine, Aaron, Judy, Elizabeth, any editors) 
5. Add info and links to the template, then collaborate with the copy editor to polish the wording and complete the bio
6. When you're done, direct message your onboarding manager in Slack
7. Onboarding manager and other editors will request updates or add it to the homesite
