# CivicActions Bio Instructions

Now that you're part of the team, we want to add your photo and bio to our team page!

## Process

1. Manager will introduce you to Content Writer/Editor
2. Review this [template](https://docs.google.com/a/civicactions.net/document/d/130qr5b3pCw6tf9-V9tDxYfm2qfU1flQWwL2M5X76yIk/edit?usp=sharing)
3. Make a COPY of the template
4. Make doc accessible for all folks in the organization to see or share it directly with appropriate folks (Alaine, Aaron, Judy, Elizabeth, any editors)
5. Add info and links to the template, then ping the content writer in Slack to schedule a 30-minute staff bio interview.
6. Send a high-quality [headshot photo](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1i1YILM5ncb376vUnVjWI_nICd1NKJM1r3ETYPreXAb8/edit) to the content writer in Slack.
7. When you're done, direct message your onboarding manager in Slack
