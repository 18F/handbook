# Skillset Survey

- Navigate to the [Skillset Survey](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Y_Dd0OfxjL61sgWlsJxYcGq0TY5Nc8sewWjzYNSx7G4/edit#gid=1186466179) spreadsheet and check to see if you have a tab already created for you first.
- If you do not have a tab yet, then create one following the [instructions](https://docs.google.com/a/civicactions.com/spreadsheets/d/1Y_Dd0OfxjL61sgWlsJxYcGq0TY5Nc8sewWjzYNSx7G4/edit#gid=1186466179) and the screenshots below.
- Review the "Scale" sheet to get a sense of what the numbers might mean - there are various interpretations on there. Pick the one(s) that make sense to you.
- Rate your current and desired level for each skill area. We encourage multi-disciplinary skillsets, so try and cover all areas you can, even if they are not often applicable to your day-to-day work.
- If you have skills (rabbit juggling?) you don't see listed, please add them to the "Suggested additions" sheet.
- Look at your deltas, and consider incorporating goals related to these into your professional development Trello board.
- Come back periodically (e.g.Â every 6 months) and update your numbers - this will allow you to track your progress over time.
