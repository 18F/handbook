### Working hours expectations

- Working hours expectations:
  - We have schedule flexibility, but request a general set schedule / core hours
  - Put appointments in your personal calendar
  - Ping slack if you're just going offline for a few
  - Basically let your team know when you're not free
  - Over communicate if you're going offline (vacation, lunch, appointment, etc.)
  - Be at the pre-scheduled meetings & tell manager if you can't attend
  - Be able to get your work done within your timebox
- We aim for the following billable utilization:
  - Fixed price projects: 100% (40 hours / week - this means you can bill your internal meetings, like pod calls, to the project)
  - Time and Materials: 85-95% (34-38 hours / week)
