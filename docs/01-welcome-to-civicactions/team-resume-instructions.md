# Team Resume Instructions

We sometimes get requests for team resumes. We use a template for formatting team resumes so they are consistent.

## Process

1. Your onboarding manager will introduce you to our Copy Writer / Editor
2. Review the [resume template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G1tZAvxAf9bKqzvrNnQwaXbq8rr9Ge6XXEwkllCAfUw/edit)
3. Make a COPY of the template
4. Make your resume doc accessible for all folks in the organization to see or share it directly with appropriate folks (Alaine, Aaron, Owen, Elizabeth, any editors)
5. Update the doc with your resume information (Some sections are specific to technology or Drupal - if these don't apply to you, simply delete those sections.)
6. Email your onboarding manager and the editor with a link to the updated resume doc
7. The editor and manager will review and save in the team resumes folder
