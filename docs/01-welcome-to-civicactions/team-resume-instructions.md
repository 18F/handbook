# Team Resume Instructions

We sometimes get requests for team resumes. We use a template for formatting team resumes so they are consistent.

## Process

1.  Your onboarder will introduce you to our Sales team.
2.  Review the [resume template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G1tZAvxAf9bKqzvrNnQwaXbq8rr9Ge6XXEwkllCAfUw/edit)
3.  The Sales will make a COPY of the resume template and begin to fill out your resume. 
4.  The Sales team will connect with you as needed to complete it.They may schedule a quick Zoom meeting to complete it together as well.
5.  The Sales team will also request copies of your degrees and certificates to keep on file.
6.  The Sales team will do final review and save youre resume in the team resumes folder.
