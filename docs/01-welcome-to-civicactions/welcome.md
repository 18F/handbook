# New Hire Orientation

## Welcome to CivicActions!

We're honored to welcome you to our company. You have joined an organization that has established an outstanding reputation for authentic communications and a commitment to being fully present, which has led to the delivery of quality products and services. Credit for this goes to every one of us. We believe in you and are excited to experience your contributions.

CivicActions operates transparently on a fundamental level. We have very few "rules and regulations." We expect everyone, individually and collectively, to be open minded, forthright, trustworthy, ethical and have a sense of humor. Because we expect it, we attract people who demonstrate exactly these qualities. Left to our own devices, this Handbook would be very short - be open, do your best, ask for help and clarification when you need it, offer help to others, and have fun.

That being said, there are topics in this document that are required by law or at least by HR professionals. You will find them under [Required Stuff](../03-policies/required-stuff.md). This Handbook is likely to be a springboard for conversations that will allow us to express our views, get to know each other better, and continually improve harmonious relationships and processes. Issues are addressed on a case-by-case basis. We want you to feel free to discuss anything with team members and/or management, whether it’s something that disturbs you, something that confuses you or something that excites you. You will find CivicActions a great place to work.

## Onboarding Process

As part of the new employee onboarding process, we created the following Onboarding Schedule to assist you through the days, weeks, and months ahead as a new team member at CivicActions.

### Schedule

See [Orientation Meetings](training/orientation-meetings.md) for a typical onboarding schedule, but the timing may shift based on when you're hired and company holidays, etc. The first week will be dedicated to general orientation. You'll also learn about our working practices, our primary tools and how we use them, and your specific job role. The rest of your first month will be dedicated to completing the trainings and task in the orientation lists, and further acclimating to your role and project(s). Welcome aboard!
