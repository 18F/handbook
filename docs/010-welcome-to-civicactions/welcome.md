## Onboarding Process

Welcome aboard! As part of the new employee onboarding process, we created a three to four day Onboarding Schedule to assist you through navigating CivicActions as a new team member. You will meet with an onboarding captain for one hour each day for three consecutive days, and then have follow up self-guided readings and tasks to help you orient. You will also be paired up with a seasoned CivicActions-er in your domain area to help you learn about our working practices and our primary tools and how we use them. You will also attend a few focused trainings around agile, security, and company culture. In addition to, your project may have additional security trainings and background checks to complete before starting on the project.
