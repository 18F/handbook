# User Personas Guide

## What it is:

Personas are representations of key audience segments that provide a clear picture of target audiences' expectations, goals and values. In other words, personas are "models of the people for whom we believe we are solving a problem" (_Lean UX_).

Typically, design personas are based on extensive field research and real people. "Proto-personas" are based on best guesses and assumptions rather than extensive user research. Following a _Lean UX_ approach, the team creates proto-personas to capture assumptions, and then adjusts personas and designs as they learn from ongoing research.

## How to do it:

There are many different persona formats and [ways to create user personas](https://www.google.com/search?source=hp&ei=QGkEW5XEGKXljwT15pKgBA&q=how+to+create+user+personas&oq=how+to+create+user+per&gs_l=psy-ab.3.0.0l2j0i22i30k1l8.2337.6160.0.7265.24.17.0.6.6.0.132.1526.9j7.17.0....0...1c.1.64.psy-ab..1.22.1541.0..0i131k1.58.Ur19LHgyFBQ) (see Examples below). Regardless of how you go about creating personas, they should reflect/capture what you assume or know about:

- The main behavior patterns of your users
- The motivations and goals of your users
- Current pain points of your users

## Why to do it:

Personas add a layer of real-world consideration to project conversations and can help to uncover the most-needed features and functionality and inform decisions about information architecture and development priorities.
