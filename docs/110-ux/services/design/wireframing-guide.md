## What Are Wireframes?

Wireframes and page tables are mockups used to convey content requirements defined and driven by messaging, business objectives and user goals, ensuring that content receives the attention it deserves at the right time during the project. Most IA documentation, page- and/or component-level documentation is captured in wireframes. Page tables identify and explain key content recommendations, taking wireframes to the next level; they include:

- Content objective(s)
- Key messages
- Specific content recommendations
- Source content quality
- Guidelines for how to create and maintain the content
