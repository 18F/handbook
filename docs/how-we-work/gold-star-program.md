# Gold Star Program

"Gold Stars" are small acts of recognition and acknowledgment for fellow team members. When someone does something outstanding, "over and above," or otherwise deserves recognition, give them a "Gold Star" by Slacking a note to the team explaining what the commendation is for.

#### How to give a Gold Star:

Post a Slack message in [#gold-star](https://civicactions.slack.com/messages/gold-star/details/) with the recipient's name and a story about why you are giving them a gold star. What did this person do? Why are you inspired to give them props?

It's that easy. HR will contact the recipient and offer a choice of a gift card or a contribution to a charity of their choosing.

We trust the CivicActions team to use this program for its intended purpose: acknowledging someone who did something truly special (and not to abuse this program by giving out hundreds of stars).

There is also an [#appreciations](https://civicactions.slack.com/messages/appreciations/details/) channel for doling out additional kudos.
