# Introduction to the Agile Baseline

The Agile Baseline documents the principles, policies, processes, methods, and tools that underpin the way we do our work. This is a living document and is updated regularly by the CivicActions Agile Champions group.

## How to Use the Baseline

The crux of this documentation is a set of how-to "guides" that describe our process as well as the various methods we use for research, design, implementation, and validation. The **Table of Contents** below provides an overview of the way content is organized in the Baseline. We recommend using this documentation in combination with our [Agile Baseline story map](https://civicactions.storiesonboard.com/m/agile-baseline-story-map), which maps out an ideal Agile project lifecycle.

For examples of fully realized "guides," check out [Sprint Planning Meetings](/03-process/practices/sprint-planning-meetings.md) and [Audiences & Outcomes](/04-methods/1-research/audiences-and-outcomes-guide.md) (we are still developing much of this content).
