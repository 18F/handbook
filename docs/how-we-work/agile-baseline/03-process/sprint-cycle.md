##Sprint Cycle

(work in progress)

##Introduction

At CivicActions, the most common approach for accomplishing large-scale work is the use of a Scrum sprint cycle. In a sprint cycle, the project team breaks down the project into smaller phases or modules, which allow them to develop a working product more rapidly. This iterative approach allows more time for testing and revisions, promoting a mindset of continuous improvement. It also allows us to continually evaluate requirements and priorities throughout the process, enabling us to accept and adapt to change.

The process details included below are especially useful for complex projects with timelines spanning 1 month or more, but have also shown to be very useful in quick-turnaround situations like proposal preparation and 1-day challenges. 


- Prioritize stories
- Prepare stories for development
  - Decompose into development tasks
  - Estimate tasks
  - Define acceptance criteria
- Implement story solutions
- Review/test implementation
- Demo/validate with users
- Repeat and repeat
