# Trello

## TL;DR

Trello is easy and intuitive.  Install the extensions listed at the bottom, and you'll figure out everything else as you go along.  

## About Trello

Trello is a collaborative task and project management tool that we use extensively at CivicActions. CivicActions has a paid [team Trello account](https://trello.com/civicactions) that we utilize for both internal and client projects.

If you're not already familiar with Trello, https://trello.com/guide has a good guide to getting started.

Trello is very easy to use, and has an intuitive interface.  It is well documented at https://trello.com/guide, but you probably won't need to read much documentation. 


## The Basics and some naming conventions.

Trello has "boards" where work is tracked.  Work can be done by any member of the board, who need to be added by admins.  Sometimes it's easier to have multiple admins. 

On each board there are "lists" which contain "cards". Cards contain actionable tasks, and can also contain subtasks (often organized on checklist items), attachments, due dates, labels, comments.  Cards can also contain references to github pull requests, images (which can appear on the "front" of the card), and can be assigned to one or more people. 

Generally, cards move from left to right on a Trello board, through a series of lists, with the "Done" list at the far right.  On many projects, you'll see lists like "Backlog", "Blocked", "Doing", "Code Review", "Ready for Client Review", "Approved", etc. 

## Powerups

Trello's business model is based on people paying for powerups, which are additional features.  We rarely need more than one or two.  Free accounts are limited to one power up.  Examples of power ups that we've used:
