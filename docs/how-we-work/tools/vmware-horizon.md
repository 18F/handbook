title: VMware Horizon
---

VMware Horizon is a VPN client that we use to connect to GSAâ€™s intranet.

## Setup

New employees should have a GSA VMware myView/Horizon account, but if not:

  1. Go to [servicedesk.gsa.gov](http://servicedesk.gsa.gov/).
  2. Sign in with your ENT username and password.
  3. Click **Submit Catalog Request**.
  4. Click **Accounts & Access Requests**.
  5. Click **myView (Virtual Desktop) Access Request**.
  6. Complete the required fields.
  7. Click **Order Now**.

## Usage

1. Once you have access, you can use myView through the web client or install the software from [https://horizon.gsa.gov/](https://horizon.gsa.gov/).
2. Log into [otp.gsa.gov](https://otp.gsa.gov) with 2-factor authentication so you can get a code to enter at horizon.gsa.gov along with your GSA password.

Note: myView/Horizon allows for a virtual desktop in browser with no downloads.
