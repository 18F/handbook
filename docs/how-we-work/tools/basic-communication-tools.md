### Basics
* We use Slack for chatting with the team -- whether as a whole, in smaller groups, or one on one.
* Ensure your status is set to "available" in Slack when online and free to chat, and "away" when not.
* Consider getting the Slack desktop app - either the native OS X / Windows one, or the Chrome app, which you can set up to run as a standalone app on system start up.

### Channels
* Slack organizes communication into **channels**. A channel can be public, so that everyone can join, or private, so that messages are shared with only select individuals. Most project channels are private by default.
* We default to open, so when in doubt, message the group in a public channel instead of a direct message, or one-on-one.
* There are a wide variety of different channels you can join, from work-related to topic-related.
* Mandatory channels include: General, Announcements, Engineering or PM, your Pod, your project channels
* Recommended channels: Random, SOTD, QOTD, Onboarding
* The [Announcements channel](https://civicactions.slack.com/messages/announcements/details/) is for **announcements only**. All replies or conversation regarding announcements can transpire in the [General channel](https://civicactions.slack.com/messages/general/). Keeping announcements chatter to a minimum ensures that anyone who hasn't been paying attention to the General or other channels will be able to quickly locate important or not-to-be-missed information.
* An [Onboarding channel](https://civicactions.slack.com/messages/onboarding/) exists which you can use for any general onboarding questions if needed.

### Notifications
* To notify someone in particular, type **@name** with your message.
* If you want to call attention to everyone subscribed to channel, write **@channel** or **@group**.
* To alert only those in a channel/group who are online, write **@here**.

### Tips
* Consider using the word "ping" to check on the availability of someone
* You can [adjust notification preferences](../images/slack-notifications.png "Slack Notifications").
* Wrap your text in single *asterisks* for bold, _underscores_ for italics, `grave accents` for code, and start the line with a > sign to make it a block quote. [Formatting in Slack](../images/slack-formatting.png "Slack Formatting") is similar to Markdown.
* To wrap single line output, use one pair of backticks ( `Your code here`). For multiple lines, wrap with three backticks (```Your code here. Some more code.```). [See screenshot](../images/backticks.png "Wrapping code").
* Create a Google Hangout from Slack: type **/hangout** (will need to authorize the slack app in hangout too)
* To quickly bring back the last message you sent back to the text box, just press the Up arrow key.

## <a name="google-apps"></a>Google Apps

### <a name="gmail"></a>Email

#### Lists

##### Internal

 * We use ca-team@lists.civicactions.net for all team wide communication, and important announcements (slack #announcements used often too)
 * We us ca-employees@lists.civicactions.net for HR notices, etc. (it is generally low traffic)
 * Other email lists: ca-[functionalgroup] -hydra, -orion -sales, -dev, -team, etc.
 * Every project has its own list - a way to overhear each other

##### Client and staff lists

 * teach@lists.civicactions.net (includes clients)
 * teach-int@lists.civicactions.net (just for CivicActions staff)

#### Protocol

To get someone's attention, put their name in all caps in subject. Or use "ALL" to get everyone's attention. For example:

* Subject: "RICHARD: are you around this afternoon?"
* Subject: "ALL: please update your hours by EOD"
* Subject: "URGENT: please update your hours by EOD"

#### Email Filters

Consider using [filters](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/6579?hl=en) to help manage you mail in preparation for quick archive.

### <a name="google-calendar"></a>Google Calendar

#### Best Practices
* Set your location, time zone and working hours (& keep them current) using [Calendar Settings](../images/CivicActions_Calendar_Settings.png "Calendar settings")
* Always send invitations to first.last@civicactions.com
* Make sure your main first.last@civicactions.com calendar is at sharing at least free/busy with everyone in CivicActions
* Consider enabling "speedy meetings" (in Settings)
* Reply to meeting invitations (yes, no, maybe)
* Use the "optional" feature for attendees who are not required to attend
* Use the ["Find a Time"](../images/CivicActions_Calendar_FindTime.png "Find a time") feature to identify a meeting time where all required participants are free.
* Complete the Event Details section when creating an event
* If your event is related to a ticket, then include the ticket reference in the event title (i.e. a Jira RD-19 ticket event could be "Prototype Meeting RD-19")
* You can create a Hangout link from the event (actually, Hangout links, aka "video calls" are automatically generated when you create a new event)
* Add the ["CivicActions: Out of Office"](../images/ooo-cal1.png "Out of Office Calendar") calendar

### <a name="google-hangouts"></a>Google Hangouts

#### Best Practices
* Be on time - please! Every 10 seconds actually matters
* Add a photo to your account so it shows up in Hangout
* We use the chat and screensharing features often
* Turn off your camera or reduce bandwidth if connection is poor
* Use the mute button so mute is transparent to all (vs headphone muting)
* Use some kind of headset or headphones instead of relying solely on computer mic (computer mics can sometimes create echoes)
* You can also use the Hangout to [call people in via phone](../images/hangouts-phone.png "Call from hangouts")
* We can invite people outside of CivicActions, too
* Use proper etiquette for Hangout professionalism (consider the appropriateness of background visuals/noise, attire/dress, use of effects, eating, muting, etc.)
* It's okay to mute other each other

### <a name="google-docs"></a>Google Docs

* Google Docs allows you to create and share a variety of documents such as text documents, spreadsheets, presentations, and forms.
* Google Docs should be shared with your CivicActions email account
* If a link is shared with you, you can add yourself to the share list so you can reference it later on
* If you are using a template, always make a COPY
* Update default paragraph styles to match CivicActions standard styles when creating new docs to use/share
* If you create a document, make sure the whole team can find it and has access to it so you don't need to grant individual permissions
