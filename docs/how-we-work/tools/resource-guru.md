# Resource Guru

## Introduction
We use Resource Guru (RG) for keeping track of team member availability and projects. Your PM will keep this updated, but you are always welcome to login to review/look ahead: https://civicactions.resourceguruapp.com/.

Watch the [Resource Guru overview video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2m9Yv3LDj8).

## Updating your Profile

Within RG, we encourage you to upload a photo, update your skills, and look at your project schedules as they evolve.

1. Log in to Resource Guru: https://civicactions.resourceguruapp.com/login

2. Go to Resources: https://civicactions.resourceguruapp.com/resources

3. Click on your name, then click "Edit" to upload a photo, set your time zone, set your availability, Job Title, Pod, Skills, etc.

## Expectations around scheduling PTO in RG
We discourage any employee from entering PTO in RG without first confirming it with their delivery manager and PM. After time off is approved, employees are welcome to update their own RG schedules.

Questions about PTO may be answered [here](https://github.com/CivicActions/handbook#pto).
