ClamXav is an anti-virus and malware scanner for Mac OS X with the ability to detect both Mac and Windows threats.


## Installation

1. Download ClamXav through 18F&rsquo;s [Managed Software Center](/managed-software-center).
2. Accept the software licensing agreement.
3. Register ClamXav by clicking [this link](https://www.clamxav.com/installRegistration/CLA151230-5218-44105). You may receive an `External Protocol Request` warning. Please **do not** select **Remember my choice for all links of this type**.
4. Click **Launch Application** in the External Protocol Request window.

6. Click **Continue** in the next two windows and then click **Install** to run the installer.
7. Enter your administrator name and password to continue. If you're not an administrator on your Mac, ping [Kimber Dowsett](https://18f.slack.com/team/kimber) for assistance.
8. Click **Install Software.**
9. In the **Check for updates automatically?** window, deselect the **Include anonymous system profile** checkbox.
10. Click **Check Automatically**. You may need to update ClamXav again, which requires your administrator username and password.

## Update the virus definitions

Once you have the latest version:

1. Open **ClamXav Preferences > General**, select the **Update virus definitions on launch** checkbox.
2. Click **OK**.
3. Click **Update Definitions**. ClamXav will alert you when all virus definitions are updated (this takes about two minutes).

## Usage
