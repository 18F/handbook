Mura.ly is a collaborative whiteboard and sticky note tool.

## Setup

Because Murally is a web application, there’s no installation necessary. You will need to set up an account, however. If you don’t already have a Mural.ly account, visit [this link](http://mrl.li/mnEPxzBV) and create an account with your GSA email address. In order to have access to all CivicActions public rooms and create your own rooms, you need an admin (Hillary Hartley, Noah Kunin, or Noah Manger) to give you those permissions.

## Usage

- Mural.ly consists of “rooms” (for example, FEC) and “murals” (for example, User Research). There’s only one “team:” CivicActions.
- Rooms can be public or private to the rest of the team. If rooms within the CivicActions group are set to public, anyone at CivicActions can view them. If they’re private, only people specifically invited to them can see them.
- You can give access to individual boards or rooms to anyone, including people outside of CivicActions or GSA, and doing so will not give them access to other public rooms without an administrator’s approval.
