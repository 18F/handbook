AnyConnect is a VPN client that we use to connect to GSA's intranet.

## Setup

1. Download [AnyConnect](https://drive.google.com/a/gsa.gov/file/d/0B0kAEM4mkbZ1XzMyQzdjYUdyUHM/edit) and launch the installer.
2. Follow the prompts to install the VPN client. Deselect the other components or else the installation may fail. Your install screen should look like this:

## Usage

1. Make sure you are not connected to a GSA network, otherwise the connection will fail.
2. Launch the Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client.
3. Enter `vpn.gsa.gov/gfeotp` in the Site Name field.
4. Click **Connect**.
5. Sign in with your ENT username and password. Your username is your full name, including your middle initial.
6. You'll be prompted for an answer or token. Enter the OTP code from the [SecureAuth Authenticate](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/secureauth-otp/id615536686?mt=8) app or [otp.gsa.gov](https://otp.gsa.gov).

## Troubleshooting

If your VPN client hangs while trying to authorize your credentials, delete the `/opt/cisco/anyconnect/profile/gsa_cp-gfe.xml` file on your system.

If you're still having trouble, try these recommendations from [@moncef](https://civicactions.slack.com/team/moncef):

1. Open the Terminal.
2. Type `cd /opt` and press **Return**.
3. Type `sudo rm -rf cisco` and press **Return**.
4. Search the Finder for `cisco` ([including system files](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202121)) and delete the files.
5. Restart your computer.
6. Reinstall AnyConnect without any add-ons.
