## About GitHub
GitHub is a publicly available, free service which hosts the source code for tens of thousands of open source projects. CivicActions uses GitHub for all open source projects (except those which are better hosted on an open source community infrastructure), as well as internal, client or pro-bono projects that should be developed in public. Client projects that are not developed in public do not use GitHub, but usually use GitLab: [https://git.civicactions.net](https://git.civicactions.net).

## Setting Up Your Account
Many CivicActions employees will already have a GitHub account. If you don't have one yet, now's a great time to create one! Follow these steps:

1. Sign up with a free profile on [https://github.com/join](https://github.com/join).  
  a. As always, please use a unique, secure password.  
  b. Use a personal email account, not your CivicActions one, so that your GitHub account will be portable.
2. Ask a coworker to add you to the CivicActions organization.
3. Find out the details of the repositories you'll be working with.

## Setting up Git and a local repository
In order to start working, you'll want to set up Git on your computer and clone a local copy of the repository you're working with. You can find instructions at [https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/)

Many projects will have special requirements for local repositories, especially for engineers. Ask your coworkers for help!
