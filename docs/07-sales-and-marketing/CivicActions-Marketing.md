# CivicActions Marketing

At our 2018 retreat we decided to break Marketing into distinct areas: Brand, Events, Content & Community (TBD)

We believe this will have us better focus on how to serve the team and provide value to the civic tech community.

## Events

We attend events and conferences for a number of different purposes. Among these include:

- Recruitment (Hiring Team)
- Business Development (Sales Team)
- Professional Development (Team Members)
- Community Participation & Speaking

### Core Events

CivicActions sponsors and attends a few events every year, primarily for recruiting purposes. These "Core Events" include the following:

- LibrePlanet (March)
- DrupalCon North America (April)
- AGL Summit (May)
- Code for America Summit (May)
- DevOps Days DC (July)
- Drupal GovCon (July)

The Events Team manages the sponsorship and planning of the Core Events with support from team members as needed.

### Speaking at Events

We highly encourage team members to share knowledge at conferences and have a number of initiatives to support these efforts.

CivicActions will pay all costs for travel, registration, attendance, etc., for any team member that has conference presentation accepted at a Core Event. (Marketing > Core Events budget)

CivicActions will pay all costs up to \$1200/year per person to be used for travel, registration, attendance, etc. for any team member that has conference presentation accepted at a Non-Core Event. (Community Participation > Speaking Stipend)

The Stipend is available three months after the beginning of employment and is reset at the calendar year. Speaking submissions and participation at non-core events are completely at the discretion of every team member, but we request you take into account your project delivery's schedule and check-in with your Project Manager to make sure it won't negatively impact your client delivery expectations.

### Professional Development Stipend

Every team member has an annual \$1,200 ProDev Stipend they can use to attend any conference or event to support their own professional learning. There is no requirement on the type of event a team member can attend, and it is not required or expected they would speak at a ProDev event.

The ProDev stipend is not limited to events, and can also be used for books, webinars, online classes, apps, or any other ways of improving one's skills.
