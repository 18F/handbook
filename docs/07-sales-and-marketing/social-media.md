# Social Media

## <a id="leadership">Leadership</a>

The content team maintains CivicActions' presence on social media. We use social media to share our work, help people learn, and to participate in the wider civic tech community. Our social media posts generally fall into three categories:

*   Promoting the achievements of CivicActions team members
*   Sharing about our job opportunities
*   Connecting to the larger civic tech community

## Social channels
*   [Twitter](https://twitter.com/CivicActions)
*   [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/54684)
*   [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/CivicActions/)
*   [Medium](https://medium.com/civicactions) (blog)

## Requesting Tweets and promotion
If you have something you think the content team should promote on social media, please make a request in our Slack channel:

## Privacy and consent
**Team member privacy preferences** 
CivicActions uses photos of our team on social media and our website to attract talent, celebrate our achievements, and connect to the civic tech community. By working at CivicActions you are agreeing to the use of your likeness in photos for these purposes.

However, not everyone wants their professional life online, and that’s okay. Every CivicActions team member is asked to document their privacy preferences using the [CivicActions team member social media privacy preferences form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdiqahFTJfs6SgiWAb9Xm1U7yCalzLdoxswfjgJ7gaxKIScGQ/viewform). You can let us know whether it’s okay to include your name, @mention your account, or use photos of you in our social media posts. 

You can also tell us if you don’t want us to use photos of you on our website, civicactions.com. CivicActions does not use photos of team members who are the primary subject of the image for promotional purposes without their consent. We may use group photos in which you appear as long as you are not the primary subject of the photo.

Anyone who plans to publicly promote CivicActions with content that includes individual team members (such as posting a group photo on social media)  should first check with the #content team to make sure that your post doesn’t violate anyone’s privacy preferences. (It’s okay to post photos in our CivicActions Slack.)
