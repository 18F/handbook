# CivicActions Marketing

The marketing team uses a community-driven approach to strategically attract the right talent, clients, and partners to work with CivicActions. Marketing is also a way for us to promote best practices and help shape the conversation around government digital services. We do this through a variety of initiatives such as:

- [Homesite at civicactions.com](https://civicactions.com/)
- [Blog](https://medium.com/civicactions)
- [Public speaking](https://civicactions.com/talks) at events and online
- Participation in [communities](https://civicactions.com/communities) that support our work and [values](https://civicactions.com/values)
- Contributions to industry organizations such as [Techwire](https://www.techwire.net/author/civicactions) and [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/civicactions)
- Social media such as [Twitter](https://twitter.com/civicactions), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/CivicActions/), and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/civicactions/)
- Cultivating opportunities to appear in [press and news](https://civicactions.com/press)

**Strategy and OKRs**
Marketing is using [Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)](https://www.whatmatters.com/faqs/do-i-need-okrs-goals/) to set and track measurable goals. View [Marketing OKRs here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bd0_pxo2fBOEOQpj1UU8cXPdLul5o_3-).

## Events

We attend events and conferences for a number of purposes, including:

- Community Participation & Speaking

**Core Events**
The current list of "core events" that CivicActions sponsors and attends each year includes:

- Code for America Summit (May)
- DevOps Days DC (July)

The Events Team manages the sponsorship and planning of the Core Events with support from team members as needed. **Event sponsorship and attendance are on hold until public health considerations are resolved.**

### Speaking at Events

We highly encourage team members to share knowledge at conferences and have a number of initiatives to support these efforts.

CivicActions will pay all costs for travel, registration, attendance, etc., for any team member that has conference presentation accepted at a Core Event. (Marketing > Core Events budget)

Here's a [running list of public presentations](https://airtable.com/shrwEraiWKvbAScC7) by CivicActions folks.  
To get started or share idea about attending or speaking at events, head over to the Slack channel #events.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
CivicActions will pay all costs up to $1200/year per person to be used for travel, registration, attendance, etc. for any team member that has conference presentation accepted at a Non-Core Event. (Community Participation > Speaking Stipend)

The Stipend is available three months after the beginning of employment and is reset at the calendar year. Speaking submissions and participation at non-core events are completely at the discretion of every team member, but we request you take into account your project delivery's schedule and check-in with your Project Manager to make sure it won't negatively impact your client delivery expectations.

### Professional Development Stipend

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
Every team member has an annual $1,200 ProDev Stipend they can use to attend any conference or event to support their own professional learning. There is no requirement on the type of event a team member can attend, and it is not required or expected they would speak at a ProDev event.

The ProDev stipend is not limited to events, and can also be used for books, webinars, online classes, apps, or any other ways of improving one's skills.
