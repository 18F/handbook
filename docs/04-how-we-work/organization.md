# Organization

CivicActions is organized into several types of organizational units. These come in 2 major categories - cross-functional and functional groups.

These two categories form a matrix and a symbiotic relationship that enhances learning, coordination and efficiency across the company.

## Cross-functional

Cross-functional groups are the primary teams and primary focus of everyone at CivicActions.

You can identify a cross-functional group because it is typically:
* Comprised of people from different disciplines and with different skills.
* Engaged in serious work: the team has a backlog, deliverables and deadlines.
* Meeting frequently - normally daily.

### Working groups

These are permanent teams that are similar to typical company departments such as management, marketing, sales, delivery and IT/IS. They have responsibility for making decisions, allocating resources and achieving company-wide goals.

### Internal projects

These are temporary projects initiated by a working group to achieve a specific goal - for example delivering a sales proposal, marketing event or internal infrastructure.

### Delivery projects

These are client projects initiated by sales and managed by delivery.

## Functional

Functional groups are the means by which we develop expertise and learning as well as ...

### Service areas

A service area is the group of people involved with a particular service or set of services that we deliver. 

### Practice areas

A group based around a practice or craft, like project management, engineering, sales etc - orientation towards learning and cross-pollination of ideas. Practice areas can be started and run by anyone. Cross pollination can happen within the practice (but across projects & working groups), to/from other practice areas or to broader sharing spaces (e.g. the engineering call or AHC).
