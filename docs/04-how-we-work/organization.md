These form symbiotic relationships that enhance learning, coordination and efficiency across the company.

Permanent operational teams such as sales and marketing - responsibility for making decisions, allocating resources and achieving company-wide goals.

## Internal projects

## Practice areas

Internal facing: self-organized group oriented around a specific practice or craft - oriented towards learning, continuous improvement and cross-pollination of ideas and best practice across the company.

## Pods
