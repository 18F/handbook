# Harvest Forecast

## Introduction

We use [Harvest Forecast](https://forecastapp.com/615047/schedule/projects) for keeping track of team member availability and projects. Your PM will keep this updated, but you are always welcome to login to review/look ahead.

## Expectations around scheduling time off in Forecast

We discourage any employee from entering scheduled time off in Forecast without first confirming it with their delivery manager and PM. After time off is approved, employees are welcome to update their own Forecast schedules.

Questions about time off may be answered [here](../../03-policies/benefits-and-holidays.md#timeoff).
