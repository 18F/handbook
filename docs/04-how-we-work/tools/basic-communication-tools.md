# Basic Communication Tools

## Slack

### Basics

* We use Slack for chatting with the team – whether as a whole, in smaller groups, or one on one.
* Ensure your status is set to "available" in Slack when online and free to chat, and "away" when not.
* Consider getting the Slack desktop app - either the native OS X / Windows one, or the Chrome app, which you can set up to run as a standalone app on system start up.
* Make sure to add a photo of yourself for your Slack avatar

### Channels

* Slack organizes communication into **channels**. A channel can be public, so that everyone can join, or private, so that messages are shared with only select individuals. Most project channels are private by default.
* We default to open, so when in doubt, message the group in a public channel instead of a direct message, or one-on-one.
* There are a wide variety of different channels you can join, from work-related to topic-related.
* Mandatory channels include: General, Announcements, Engineering or PM, your Pod, your project channels
* Recommended channels: how-we-work, random, sotd, qotd, gold-star, prodev
* The [Announcements channel](https://civicactions.slack.com/messages/announcements/details/) is for **announcements only**. All replies or conversation regarding announcements can transpire in the [General channel](https://civicactions.slack.com/messages/general/). Keeping announcements chatter to a minimum ensures that anyone who hasn't been paying attention to the General or other channels will be able to quickly locate important or not-to-be-missed information.

### Notifications

* To notify someone in particular, type **@name** with your message.
* If you want to call attention to everyone subscribed to channel, write **@channel** or **@group**.
* To alert only those in a channel/group who are online, write **@here**.

### Tips

* Consider using the word "ping" to check on the availability of someone
* Create a Google Hangout from Slack: type **/hangout** (will need to authorize the slack app in hangout too)
* To quickly bring back the last message you sent back to the text box, just press the Up arrow key.
* You can adjust notification preferences:
  ![Slack Notifications](../../images/slack-notifications.png)
* Wrap your text in single asterisks for **bold**, underscores for *italics*, `grave accents` for code, and start the line with a > sign to make it a block quote. Formatting in Slack is similar to Markdown.![Formatting in Slack](../../images/slack-formatting.png "Slack Formatting")
* To wrap single line output, use one pair of backticks ( `Your code here`). For multiple lines, wrap with three backticks (`Your code here. Some more code.`). ![Wrapping code](../../images/backticks.png "Wrapping code")

## Google Apps

### Email

#### Internal lists

* We use ca-team@lists.civicactions.net for all team wide communication, and important announcements (slack #announcements used often too)
* We use ca-employees@lists.civicactions.net for HR notices, etc. (it is generally low traffic)
* Other email lists: ca-\[functionalgroup] -sales, -dev, -team, etc.
* Every project has its own list as a way to overhear each other

#### Client and staff lists

* projectname@lists.civicactions.net (includes clients)
* projectname-int@lists.civicactions.net (just for CivicActions staff)

#### Protocol

We default to using our mailing lists for transparency instead of direct email messages. To get someone's attention, put their name in all caps in subject. Or use "ALL" to get everyone's attention. For example:

* Subject: "RICHARD: are you around this afternoon?"
* Subject: "ALL: please update your hours by EOD"
* Subject: "URGENT: please update your hours by EOD"

#### Email Filters

Consider using [filters](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/6579?hl=en) to help manage you mail in preparation for quick archive.

### Google Calendar

#### Overview

**CivicActions uses shared calendars** in [Google Calendar](../../04-how-we-work/tools/basic-communication-tools.md#google-calendar) for CivicActions standing meetings, birthdays, and "out of office" time.

**You can specify which hours you work.** From the guide: "About a third of the way down the 'General' settings' page there's a section called 'Working hours' and a checkbox that's unchecked by default. If you check it, you can specify your preferred working hours. Once you save your changes, other people will get a warning if they try to schedule you outside those times."

**You can see other people's public calendars to help schedule meetings.** To view someone else's calendar, type their name in the lefthand column under "other calendars." Finally, there's a link titled "Find a time" (left of what's shown in the gif, below) which shows everyone's schedules next to each other so you can easily see when there are no conflicts.

**You can set up blocks of time that people can reserve.** Just select "Appointment slots" after you choose a window of time.

#### Best Practices

* Set your location, time zone and working hours (& keep them current) using calendar settings: ![Calendar Settings](../../images/CivicActions_Calendar_Settings.png "Calendar settings")
* Always send invitations to <mailto:first.last@civicactions.com>
* Make sure your main <mailto:first.last@civicactions.com> calendar is at sharing at least free/busy with everyone in CivicActions
* Consider enabling "speedy meetings" (in Settings)
* Reply to meeting invitations (yes, no, maybe)
* Use the "optional" feature for attendees who are not required to attend
* Use the Find a Time feature: !["Find a Time"](../../images/CivicActions_Calendar_FindTime.png "Find a time") feature to identify a meeting time where all required participants are free.
* Complete the Event Details section when creating an event
* If your event is related to a ticket, then include the ticket reference in the event title (i.e. a Jira RD-19 ticket event could be "Prototype Meeting RD-19")
* You can create a Hangout link from the event (actually, Hangout links, aka "video calls" are automatically generated when you create a new event)
* Add the Out of Office Calendar !["CivicActions: Out of Office"](../../images/ooo-cal1.png "Out of Office Calendar") calendar

### Google Hangouts

#### Overview
Google Hangouts are video chats in the browser. Here are some tips for using Hangouts:

* **You can add a Google Hangout to a meeting invite** by clicking "Add video call" on the event management page.
* **You can also start or share a hangout from Slack** by typing `/hangout`.
* **You can dial people into a Hangout.** A Hangout's "invite" dialog can generate a phone number that people can call.
* Use screensharing for demos and for pairing.

#### Best Practices

* Be on time - please! Every 10 seconds actually matters
* Default to video on for all video meetings
* Add a photo to your account so it shows up in Hangout if your camera is off
* We use the chat and screensharing features often
* Turn off your camera or reduce bandwidth if connection is poor
* Use some kind of headset or headphones instead of relying solely on computer mic (computer mics can sometimes create echoes)
* Use proper etiquette for Hangout professionalism (consider the appropriateness of background visuals/noise, attire/dress, use of effects, eating, muting, etc.)
* It's okay to mute other each other
* We can invite people outside of CivicActions
* You can also use the Hangout to call people in via phone: ![call people in via phone](../../images/hangouts-phone.png "Call from hangouts")
* If you want to focus on just one participant (or their screen, if they're screensharing), you can stop the screen from switching by clicking on their picture/screenshare. To go back to automated switching, just click it again. ![stop screen switching](../../images/stop_screen_switching_in_hangouts.png "Stop screen switching in hangouts")
* If someone hears an echo & you don't, then it's likely your computer creating the echo. You can try to plug in headphones or unplug & replug them in. 

#### Available Commands

* /to, /msg \[user]\[message] - Sends an inline private message to the specified user.
* /shortcuts - Open keyboard shortcut help screen
* /help, /? - Displays a list of command descriptions and usages.
* /goto \[user] - Opens the profile of the specified user in a new tab.

### Google Docs

* Google Docs allows you to create and share a variety of documents such as text documents, spreadsheets, presentations, and forms.
* Google Docs should be shared with your CivicActions email account
* If a link is shared with you, you can add yourself to the share list so you can reference it later on
* If you are using a template, always make a COPY
* Update [default paragraph styles](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1n1Jdu4vAnO0YCppo9YO2BkSYGyOqUCSJOrfrBBzBPBM/edit#) to match CivicActions standard styles when creating new docs to use/share
* When you create a document, set permissions so "anyone at CivicActions can find and access"
* Make sure to place documents & files in appropriate project folder instead of it living at your personal My Drive

## Zoom

* We use [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) video conferencing software for larger meetings, such as our weekly and monthly All Hands Calls. To participate, you may download the Zoom app, view in browser, or call in from a telephone (just don't forget to mute yourself!).
* In the past we've also used [BlueJeans](https://www.bluejeans.com/).
* Login with your CivicActions email. You will see a link below the signin box that reads, "Or, sign in with Google..." so click that and proceed to login via your CivicActions email (may automatically do it if you're already logged in via your browser)

## Telephone Use

* There are times when a phone call in may also be necessary, such as when wifi is not available or to call in to Zoom
* Don't rely on speaker feature, but have a headset handy
* You may need to be called into a Google Hangout if you can't attend the video meeting
* Sharing your phone number with the client/PO is optional
