# Markdown

## What is it?

Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. It's relatively easy to learn and use, and displays well on GitHub; versions of it are also used in Slack, Trello and Jira, among others. This documentation is written using it. It's worth learning, if you haven't already. Markdown can be really easy to use with a good editor such as some of these [text editors](../..//04-how-we-work/tools/text-editors.md).

There's a great tutorial [on the Commonmark website](http://commonmark.org/help/tutorial/).
