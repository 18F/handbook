## What is it?

Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. It's relatively easy to learn and use, and displays well on GitHub; versions of it are also used in Slack, Trello and Jira, among others. This documentation is written using it. It's worth learning, if you haven't already.
