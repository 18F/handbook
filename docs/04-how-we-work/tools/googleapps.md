### Lists

#### Internal
* ca-team for all team wide communication, and important announcements (slack #announcements used often too)
* ca-employees is generally low traffic and used for HR notices, etc
* projectname-\[functionalgroup\] -teamname, etc
* Every project has it's own list - a way to overhear each other

#### Client lists
Example:

* project@lists.civicactions.net (includes clients)
* project-int@lists.civicactions.net (just for CivicActions staff on the project)

#### Protocol
To get someone's attention, but their name in all caps in subject. Or use "ALL" to get everyone's attention.

#### Example:

* Subject: "RICHARD: are you around this afternoon?"
* Subject: "ALL: please update your hours by EOD"
* Subject: "URGENT: please update your hours by EOD"

#### Email Filters
Consider using filers to help manage you mail in preparation for quick archive

### Best Practices

* Set your time zone
* Set your working hours (& keep it current)
* Set your location
* Always send invitations to first.last@civicactions.com
* Make sure your main first.last@civicactions.com calendar is at sharing at least free/busy with everyone in CivicActions.
* Consider enabling "speedy meetings"
* Reply to meeting invitations (yes, no, maybe)
* Use the "optional" feature for attendees who are not required to attend
* Use the "Find a Time" feature (see image below)
* Use the Event Details section
* If your event is related to a ticket, then include the ticket reference in the event title (i.e. a Jira RD-19 ticket event could be "Prototype Meeting RD-19")
* Can create the hangouts from these events
* Consider Labs: Gentle Notifications
* Add the "CivicActions: Out of Office" calendar

### Talking points
* Be on time - please! Every 10 seconds actually matters
* We use the chat feature often
* Can also use it for screensharing
* Ways to reduce bandwidth if connection is bad - turn off camera, etc
* Use the mute button so mute is transparent to all (vs headphone muting)
* Use some kind of headset instead of relying solely on computer mic (computer mics can sometimes create echoes)
* Can also use the hangout to call people in via phone
* We can invite people outside of CivicActions too
* Add a photo to your account so it shows up in Hangout
* Proper etiquette for hangout professionalism (background visual & noise, attire/dress, using effects, eating, muting etc)
* It's ok to mute other each other

## <a name="drive"></a>Drive and Docs

* These are shared with your CivicActions email account
* If a link is shared with you, you can add yourself to the share list so you can reference it later on
* If it's a template, always make a COPY
* Update default paragraph styles to match CivicActions standard styles when creating new docs to use/share
* If you created the document, make sure the whole team can find it so you don't need to grant permissions
* Be extremely cautious about sharing documents to individuals not on staff; if in doubt, consult with others on your project about sharing protocol.
