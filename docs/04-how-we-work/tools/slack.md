# Slack

## Basics

- We use Slack for chatting with the team â€“ whether as a whole, in smaller groups, or one on one.
- Ensure your status is set to "available" in Slack when online and free to chat, and "away" when not.
- Consider getting the Slack desktop app - either the native OS X / Windows one, or the Chrome app, which you can set up to run as a standalone app on system start up.
- Make sure to add a photo of yourself for your Slack avatar

## Channels

- Slack organizes communication into **channels**. A channel can be public, so that everyone can join, or private, so that messages are shared with only select individuals. Most project channels are private by default.
- We default to open, so when in doubt, message the group in a public channel instead of a direct message, or one-on-one.
- There are a wide variety of different channels you can join, from work-related to topic-related.
- Mandatory channels include: General, Announcements, How We Work, your Pod, your project channels, your domain area channels (Engineering, UX, PM, etc).
- Optional channels: You are welcome to poke around Slack and join any open channels that you would like to (#pets, #gardening, #parenting, #sotd, #books, etc) - go to the "Channel Browser" and look around!
- The [Announcements channel](https://civicactions.slack.com/messages/announcements/details/) is for **announcements only**. All replies or conversation regarding announcements can transpire in the [General channel](https://civicactions.slack.com/messages/general/). Keeping announcements chatter to a minimum ensures that anyone who hasn't been paying attention to the General or other channels will be able to quickly locate important or not-to-be-missed information.

## Notifications

- To notify someone in particular, type **@name** with your message.
- If you want to call attention to everyone subscribed to channel, write **@channel** or **@group**.
- To alert only those in a channel/group who are online, write **@here**.

## IT Support / Halp

- Halp is a Slack bot that we use to submit requests to our internal support team, responsible for supporting:
  - Internal systems and services (Slack, Zoom, Google Groups, GitLab, CI server, etc.)
  - Project sandbox / CI escalations
- To request support, do one of the following:
  - Ping the internal support team directly using the @it-help handle in the relevant Slack channel
  - Use the `/halp` slash command in the relevant Slack channel to create a support ticket yourself
  - To quickly create a ticket directly from a Slack message, click "More actions" and select "Create Halp Ticket". Alternatively, react to the message using the :ticket: emoji.
  - DM any of the support team directly (@zoe, @daven, and @grugnog)
- Halp will create a Slack thread representing the ticket to track its status and document further discussion

## Tips

- Consider using the word "ping" to check on the availability of someone
- Create a Google Meet from Slack: type **/hangout** (will need to authorize the slack app in Meet/Hangout too)
- To quickly bring back the last message you sent back to the text box, just press the Up arrow key.
- You can adjust notification preferences:

- Wrap your text in single asterisks for **bold**, underscores for _italics_, `grave accents` for code, and start the line with a > sign to make it a block quote. Formatting in Slack is similar to Markdown.![Formatting in Slack](../../images/slack-formatting.png "Slack Formatting")
- To wrap single line output, use one pair of backticks ( `Your code here`). For multiple lines, wrap with three backticks (`Your code here. Some more code.`). ![Wrapping code](../../images/backticks.png "Wrapping code")
