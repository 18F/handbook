# Slack

## Basics

* We use slack for chatting tool
* Helps us stay transparent
* Consider getting the Slack desktop app - either the native OS X / Windows one, or the Chrome app, which you can set up to run as a standalone app on system start up.
* Write specific people @name
* Calling attention to all subscribed to channel write @channel or @group
* Calling attention in a channel/group to just the people who are online write @here
* Make sure you're available in slack when online
* Make sure to add a photo of yourself for your Slack avatar
* In preferences, add your name as a keyword that pings you when mentioned (in case people forget to @ you when trying to get your attention)

## Channels

* There are a number of different channels you can join
* You SHOULD join: General, Announcements, Engineering or PM, your Pod, your project channels
* Consider also joining: Random, SOTD, QOTD, Onboarding
* [Announcements channel](https://civicactions.slack.com/messages/announcements/details/) is only for announcements, not replies to the announcement, which you can do in the General channel. It's a one-stop channel for anyone who hasn't been paying attention to the general or other channels but wants to ensure they got any important or not-to-be-missed information.
* There's a Slack [Onboarding channel](https://civicactions.slack.com/messages/onboarding/) that you can use for any general onboarding questions if you think it's helpful.

## Tips

* [Creating a snippet](https://slack.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204145658-Creating-a-Snippet)
* Create a Google Hangout w/in Slack: /hangout (will need to authorize the slack app in hangout too)
* Wrap your text in single asterisks for bold, underscores for italics, grave accents for code, and start the line with a “>” sign to make it a block quote. Formatting in Slack is similar to Markdown. see attached here.
* To quickly bring back the last message you sent back to the text box, just press the Up arrow key.
