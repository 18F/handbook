## Internal lists

- We use ca-team@lists.civicactions.net for all team wide communication, and important announcements (slack #announcements used often too)
- We use ca-employees@lists.civicactions.net for HR notices, etc. (it is generally low traffic)
- Other email lists: ca-\[functionalgroup] -sales, -dev, -team, etc.
- Every project has its own list as a way to overhear each other

## Client and staff lists

- projectname@lists.civicactions.net (includes clients)
- projectname-int@lists.civicactions.net (just for CivicActions staff)

## Protocol

We default to using our mailing lists for transparency instead of direct email messages. To get someone's attention, put their name in all caps in subject. Or use "ALL" to get everyone's attention. For example:

- Subject: "ELIZABETH: are you around this afternoon?"
- Subject: "ALL: please update your hours by EOD"
- Subject: "URGENT: please update your hours by EOD"
