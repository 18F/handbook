## What could possibly go wrong?

**Note: Things will go wrong. Even when you are not "on the road". To reduce consequences _when_ something goes wrong, do a little advance preparation _before_ something goes wrong.**

- Theft in public places
  - Working on your laptop on a side-walk caf√© sounds great. However, when focused on your work, it is easy to be unaware of incoming risks. Laptops are stolen in broad daylight from cafes when people are typing on them. Reduce this risk by picking a table far from the door - and ideally also with your back to a wall, so you can see people approaching you.
  - Smartphones stolen on public transit while people are reading on them. Reduce this risk by not standing near the doors (snatch-and-grab as the doors are closing is the favorite trick).
  - Car drivers: parking a car _then_ putting all the valuables in the trunk _then_ walking away is a clear invitation for problems. Instead put all valuables in the trunk _before_ you start driving, so when you arrive and park, there is no need to open the trunk in front of any casual eyes.
  - All of the above happens in the bay area and other major cities. The risks are higher in locations where your "normal" laptop/phone is relatively more exotic (and hence have more resale value on the black market).
  - Consider travel insurance. Check that the policy covers stolen equipment and know what paperwork will be needed!

**Note: In almost all cases, the data on the laptop/phone is far more valuable then the actual laptop/phone.**

- In case your laptop or cell phone is stolen or destroyed
  - Use LastPass to protect all your accounts, CivicActions accounts and any client accounts! Once you discover the theft, login to LastPass and disable LastPass for that stolen device.
  - Make sure you have redundant two factor auth in case people try to break into your accounts before you notice the theft.
  - Make sure you regularly check code into git, and consider a remote backup if you have critical work files that are not stored in Google Drive, Dropbox or in repositories
  - Know shops where you can quickly repair/replace technology if needed
  - Consider backing up your coding configuration in a GitHub repo where you can clone from it and quickly get back to work.
