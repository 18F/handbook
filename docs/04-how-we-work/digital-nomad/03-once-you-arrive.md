# Once you arrive

*   Confirm connectivity
    *   Check power outlets, adapters and internet.
    *   Find another location that can be your "backup wifi location" and test there also.

*   Try to set up a consistent sleep (and work!) schedule as quickly as possible
    *   Update slack with your working hours

*   Find social outlets
    *   Are there coworking spaces or expat clubs or meetups in your area?  Find ways to communicate with other humans and make social connections.
    *   Make sure you take time to enjoy your new location. Balance means that you are able to focus on work, but also that you are able to experience life in your new location.
    *   Send us all a picture of your new workspace on slack!
    *   Take a picture of the cover of Distributed Teams (preferably with some local features in the background) and send it to John.
