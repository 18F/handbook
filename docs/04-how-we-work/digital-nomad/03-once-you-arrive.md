# Once you arrive

*   Reserve the first few days as "vacation" days - not work days.
    *   Take a day/two/three to get your new work/life setup before you attempt to focus on work. You'll need time to focus on setup of home, finding your way around, figuring out shops/phones/ISPs/transit/housing/co-working spaces, etc. Depending on the location, you may also have jetlag. Only after you have all that organized should you attempt to focus on work! If you attempt to focus on work, before you have setup your new life in the new location, you'll be distracted and unproductive in both.
*   Confirm connectivity
    *   Check power outlets, adapters and internet.
    *   Find another location that can be your "backup wifi location" and test there also.

*   Try to set up a consistent sleep (and work!) schedule as quickly as possible
    *   Update slack with your working hours

*   Find social outlets
    *   Are there coworking spaces or expat clubs or meetups in your area? Find ways to communicate with other humans and make social connections.
    *   Make sure you take time to enjoy your new location. Balance means that you are able to focus on work, but also that you are able to experience life in your new location.
    *   Send us all a picture of your new workspace on slack!
    *   Take a picture of the cover of Distributed Teams (preferably with some local features in the background) and send it to John.
