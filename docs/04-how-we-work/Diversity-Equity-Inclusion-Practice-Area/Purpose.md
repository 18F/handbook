# Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion at CivicActions

## Who we are

We are a group of CivicActioners who gather to work on creating justice in our workplace and in the world through company DEI initiatives. The Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Practice Area started in Spring 2018, and meets monthly to organize our work.

## Our purpose

At Civicactions we believe that [working for the greater good](http://civicactions.com/values) requires committing to diversity, equity, and inclusion in both our team culture and our work on problems that shape civic life.

We recognize that we have a responsibility to address the inequality that permeates our lives as civic tech workers and individuals. As a practice area, our purpose is to find opportunities to address unjust practices and create greater inclusivity in our company, our industry, and beyond.

## Why DEI is important to us

- Our **public sector clients** count on us to create equitable solutions for the diversity of the people they serve, therefore we value diverse perspectives on our team that so we can better serve the public.
- Good user experience design considers everyone. We value **diversity in user research** so that our design solutions reflect the people we serve.
- Whether itâ€™s a diversity of experiences, skill sets, approaches to problem-solving, or social identity, we believe that **team diversity and inclusion** makes us better at solving problems.
