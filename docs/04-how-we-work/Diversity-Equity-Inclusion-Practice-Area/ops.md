# DEI Practice Area: Get Involved

## Join the conversation

**#diversity-equity-inclusion**
This Slack channel is for folks who want to share resources or start conversations about DEI topics. We also encourage everyone to introduce DEI-related conversations where they are likely to reach the widest and most relevant audience. For example, do you have an interesting article about diversity in recruiting for user research? Consider posting #ux, or even #general.

**Lead or attend DEI Brownbags**
These monthly 30-45 minute topic-oriented calls are for folks who are interested in talking about DEI issues together. Have something you'd like to talk about? Then you're the right person to lead the brownbag! Calls start with a brief introduction (or optional presentation) by the topic leader followed by open discussion.

**[Sign up to lead a brownbag using this Trello board](https://trello.com/b/DooWcXUf/dei-brownbag)**

## Contribute to a DEI initiative

Anyone at CivicActions who is interested can join work on a DEI initiative. To get started, ask someone in the #dei-ops channel to add you to the monthly DEI-ops call. Someone can help you find an initiative that fits your interests and capacity.

## Get support

Not everyone is at the same level of familiarity or comfort with DEI topics, and thatâ€™s okay. Team members who have questions or concerns about DEI topics, but aren't comfortable bringing them to a large group conversation or public channel can reach out to a **[DEI point-person](https://trello.com/c/5XyeNrfZ/109-dei-point-people)** for support. DEI point-people help our team talk through sensitive issues in team dynamics, answer questions, or just be there to listen. Folks can reach out to any of the DEI point-people listed in the pinned post in #diversity-equity-inclusion.
