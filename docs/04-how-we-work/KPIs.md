# Company KPIs

CivicActions tracks and reports on company Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) monthly. These KPIs are presented to the whole company at the monthly All Hands Calls (AHC).

## How to read this chart

- The first column is the KPI and the second column is the target
- A green cell indicates the highest level of KPI health and aligns with the target
- A yellow cell indicates a KPI that is trending towards or away from healthiest
- A red cell indicates the KPI is below the desired health standard

## Definition of terms

- **Key Performance Indicator (KPI):** A numerical and measurable signal that demonstrates the health of the organization and how effective we are at achieving key business objectives.
- **Current Ratio:** The current ratio is gathered from data in Quickbooks and factors together the total liabilities (owed expenses, paying vendors, what we need to pay in the short term) in order to pay people on time compared to both cash on hand and the short term money coming in from accounts receivables and other sources. This data is converted into the ratio with a target number of 1.5 or higher. If the current ratio value is too high, then even though it’s safer, it might mean there are missed opportunities to do something else with the those assets.
- **Debt-to-Equity Ratio:** The debt-to-equity ratio is similar to the current ratio, but instead of calculating the short term it factors in a long term money ratio. This formula is also calculated by data gathered from Quickbooks. The debt-to-equity ratio is calculated by looking at the total of the assets compared to all debt.
- **Profitability Percent:** The percentage is determined by taking all expenses into account, where the expenses are subtracted from all revenues earned during a period. This number is calculated on an accrual basis, where the money calculated is based only on the money earned and expensed each month, and does not factor previous or future revenues or expenses. The healthy profitability target for professional services industries is typically 20%, but can be adjusted lower if there’s a decision to increase investment elsewhere in the company (eg deciding to hire before we land work, or other investments that may not generate immediate revenues).
- **Net Labor Multiplier (NLM):** The NLM is factored by comparing the base salaries of our delivery team members to how much revenue their work is generating for the company. The total company NLM is calculated by taking the monthly payroll base (US, Canada, Contractors) divided by the monthly revenue for those team members work. Insurance, benefits, taxes, etc. are not factored into the payroll base. Industry standard NLM is 3.0. It is affected by utilization percent and base salaries for delivery team and billing rates.
- **Utilization Percent (Delivery):** The target percentage of the delivery team’s average billable time is 80% utilization (this is also an industry standard). The data for this KPI is collected from Harvest, but is filtered by only the delivery team members. The delivery team members utilization is averaged to compare to the 80% target. It is expected that some delivery team groups will be higher and some will be lower, with the anticipated goal that it evens out to the target. Also, certain individuals in the delivery team may have higher and lower targets due to other objectives they may have, or other roles they play in the company.
- **Utilization Percent (Company-wide):** The target percentage of the whole company’s time that should be billable is 60% utilization. This is also an industry standard number. The data for this KPI is collected from Harvest, and includes all team members (billable and non-billable). The delivery team and non-billable team members utilization is averaged to compare to the 60% target. The target is industry standard.
- **Overall Health Score:** Each month after the six KPIs are calculated, the CEO indicates an overall health score of red, yellow, green for the month.
- **Profit and Loss (P&L):** A financial statement that summarizes the revenues, costs, and expenses incurred during a specified period

## How the KPI data may be used

The monthly KPIs provide high level health indicators, and could raise a red flag or help understand that things are stable. These temperature checks with the data may trigger conversations to help determine what might need to be shifted. These KPIs are also used in conversations throughout company service areas as a basis for business plans (to know if the managing that part of the business is doing well).
