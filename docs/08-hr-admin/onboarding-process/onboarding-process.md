# Onboarding Process

There are generally three people involved in the process of onboarding a new employee: the Onboarding Manager, an Admin/HR contact, and an Onboarding Buddy (previously called Mentor).

## Schedule

One of the first tasks assigned to new employees is to review the [Onboarding Schedule](../../01-welcome-to-civicactions/welcome.md#onboarding-process) for their first week, which typically includes several training sessions, a daily Orientation Meeting with the Onboarding Manager and a daily check-in call with the Onboarding Buddy.

## Tasks

We use Trello boards to manage onboarding-related _tasks_, but nearly all onboarding _content_ is contained in this Handbook. Tasks are captured in several Trello board templates (see below), each of which includes suggested timelines/deadlines and links to relevant handbook content for each task.

Tools and resources for managing the process:

- [Manager Checklist (Trello board)](https://trello.com/b/FOILJ0i6/template-onboarding-manager-checklist) (for onboarding managers)
- [Admin/HR Checklist (Trello board)](https://trello.com/b/RbC0clMU/template-onboarding-admin-hr-checklist-draft) (for Judy)
- [Buddy Handbook](../../01-welcome-to-civicactions/training/buddy-program.md) (guidelines for onboarding buddy)
