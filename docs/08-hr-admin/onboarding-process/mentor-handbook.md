# Mentor Handbook

## The Role of the Mentor

The purpose of a mentor is to provide a friendly, peer-based connection between a new hire and an experienced CivicActioner. The idea is to have someone in the new hire's field to ask questions, learn of historical processes, learn how to escalate issues, and ensure the new hire's questions are answered (even things like writing subject lines for emails). Within a new hire's onboarding board many of these topics are addressed, but it's inevitable that additional questions will bubble up that a mentor is best suited to answer.

A mentor typically has been with CivicActions for at least six months to one year and is in a role similar to that of the new hire (developer with developer, PM with PM, etc). It is the responsibility of the mentor to initiate conversations on a regular basis with the assigned new hire and to nurture a positive professional relationship that encourages questions and learning.

## A Mentor's Responsibilities

* Set up regular 15-30 minute check in meetings with your new hire. The frequency of these should be twice per week for the first month, once per week in the second month, and on an as-needed basis after that.
* Facilitate conversations with your new hire during check ins, and answer any questions that come up.
* Pass along any notable issues, highlights, or questions to the onboarding manager to ensure they're addressed for future new hires.

### Mentor To-Do Checklist

* Set up and attend regular check in meetings with your new hire
* Answer questions
* Stimulate conversation

## Tips for the Mentor

* Invite your new hire to any of your project meetings that you think might be helpful to have him/her observe
* Put yourself in your new hire's shoes. What important info do you wish you had known at that time? Share it!
* Conversation starters:
* What have you been learning during your onboarding sessions with your manager?
* In what areas do you feel strong/confident?
* In what areas do you feel unsure?
* How is your project going? Are you able to apply your onboarding learnings there?
* Share some "pro-tips" with your new hire. These are typically work shortcuts and tools that make life easier. Example: Ctrl+D in Hangouts is a mute/unmute button.

(For reference only. Onboarding manager will send this.)

\[Mentor], I thought you would be a good mentor to team up with \[new hire] as s/he's still getting his feet wet with CivicActions. \[new hire] is a \[role] working on the \[project]. S/He started on \[date] with us.
\[New hire] has made great progress with settling into her/his project & role here, but there are inevitably still questions, best practices, workflows, etc that you two can work through.
\[New hire] feel free to reach out to \[mentor] with any \[role] related questions. I am still always available for a touch point as well!

I would love to see the two of you schedule a 15-30+ minute touch point twice a week for the next month. This can start anytime this week for the first one. Find a time slot that works for both of you and make a standing meeting hangout for the next 4 weeks.
Then for the following month please continue a once a week meeting for 15-30 minutes as well. Find a time slot that works for both of you and make a standing meeting hangout for those following 4 weeks as well.
Beyond these eight weeks, you are both welcome to continue to meet if you find value and/or fun in doing so!

## Other misc info for future consideration

### Cross-functional mentorship

Your cross-functional mentor is someone who is in a role opposite of your own. You may choose which cross functional role you'd like mentorship in and this can become part of your professional development.
