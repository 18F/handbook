Working groups and guilds are self-organized groups that improve practices, host discussions, and explore ideas at CivicActions. These volunteer groups decide how and where to focus their efforts and conversations. Anyone may participate in any working group or guild.

## <a id="key-concepts">Key concepts</a>

**Working groups** are self-organized. They spin up or down depending on our organizational needs.

**Guilds** are more permanent than working groups. They're either created by senior leadership, or working groups may ask senior leadership for guild status. Every guild has an executive sponsor. 

CivicActions has a [playbook](https://pages.civicactions.com/grouplet-playbook) with instructions on how to organize a working group or guild, how to maintain team cohesion, and how to produce artifacts. All groups have a Slack channel. Working-group related channels have a `wg-` in front of their name; guilds have a `g-` before the name. Feel free to jump into and out of any of the working group or guild channels to participate or ask questions. The [CivicActions Working Groups & Guilds Calendar](https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=gsa.gov_o1aqcv28k1f0nmca5bkch8los4%40group.calendar.google.com) houses all formal meeting times for working groups and guilds.

The Slack team for working group and guild leaders is `@wg-g-leads`
