# Team Resumes

We sometimes get requests for team resumes. We use a template for formatting team resumes so they are consistent.

## Process
* Your onboarding manager will introduce you to our Copy Writer / Editor
* Make a COPY of the [resume template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dwcUtAW61FA5fUzJvZqTh3DeCzNgAbMbxOgEo4_hyoM/edit)
* Make your resume doc accessible for all folks in the organization to see or share it directly with appropriate folks (Alaine, Aaron, Owen, Elizabeth, any editors)
* Update the doc with your resume information
* Email your onboarding manager and the editor with a link to the updated resume doc
* The editor and manager will review and save in the team resumes folder
