## <a name="onboarding-process"></a>Onboarding Process

As part of the new employee onboarding process, we created the following Onboarding Schedule and Checklists to assist you through the days, weeks, and months ahead as a new employee at CivicActions.

### Schedule

This is a typical onboarding schedule, but the timing may shift based on when you’re hired and federal holidays, etc.

#### <a name="week-1"></a>Week 1
The first week will be dedicated to general orientation. You’ll also learn about our working practices, our primary tools and how we use them, and your specific job role.
