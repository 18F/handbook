# <a name="prodev-compar"></a>PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT and COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION

## <a name="background-why"></a>Background - The Why
CivicActions set a goal of developing individual Professional Development plans for all team members in early 2014.  We also set a goal of strengthening Community Participation in 2014 and leveraging the intersection of participation and Marketing (See 5% Presentation).
We value Professional Development and Community Participation because they increase our skillsets, make us more valuable to our clients and result in stories that can be used to market CivicActions.


Below is a first flush implementation which we believe will enable us to address our goals.  We anticipate future revisions, based on retrospective feedback and learnings.


## <a name="logistics-policy"></a>Logistics & Policy Information
Below are the initial logistic and policy information.  We shall assess these as part of future retrospectives and update as needed.

Each team member shall meet with their line manager for a Professional Development and Community Participation meeting.
We are planning for 2 meetings in 2014, where the 2nd meeting would include a retrospective of the workflow/logistics as well as the specific vision, plan and implementation sections.  We do not know what the ideal frequency will be, (e.g. yearly, twice yearly, quarterly etc) so will be trying out some options and reflecting to identify an effective, achievable and scalable frequency.

The output of this meeting will be an initial Professional Development and Community Participation plan, customized to address  individual needs and captured on a Trello board.  Please see Rollout section at the link below for additional information and guidance.

Each full-time team member is eligible for a yearly stipend of $1,200.

The stipend will be pro rata for team members contracted to work less than full-time (40 hours/week).

New team members will have a 3-month (90 day) wait period before becoming eligible for a professional development stipend.

No more than 20% of the team can be out on planned vacation & professional development events at a time.  We are assessing if the % should be per department or company-wide.

Two (2) months’ notice  is needed on spends above $300. From time to time we may also cap the total monthly professional development spend across the company, dependent on the budget and cash flow outlook for the month.

Purchases under $50 can be made without approval, as long as they support professional development goals.  Receipts and expense sheets should be submitted in the usual way, noting as professional development costs.

There are many training and professional development opportunities available to you: You can take a course, attend a workshop, and leverage on-the-job training. Here&rsquo;s an overview.

## Mandatory training

All General Services Administration (GSA) employees are required to take mandatory training courses providing critical information about how we work in the federal space. To take these courses, please log into [GSA&rsquo;s Online University (OLU)](https://gsaolu.gsa.gov/login.asp). Please note: You may not have access to this for your first four to six weeks at CivicActions, although you can try [these steps to gain early access to OLU](/gsa-tools-equipment-and-transit/#online-university). Mandatory trainings include:

      <td><a href="https://gsaolu.gsa.gov">OLU</a></td>
      <td>30 minutes</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

After you log into OLU, select a course, follow the in-browser video instructions, and take the exam. You'll receive a certification as soon as you pass the exam, but it may take about a week for the training to be uploaded into CHRIS, the GSA's electronic personnel file system.

For the *No Fear Act* training, we recommend using Firefox or Safari with IE8 User Agent. Otherwise, it won't register that you've taken the course. Upon completion of the test, you might not be able to click on the `Exit` button as is suggested. Try closing the window that the test was in and clicking next on the parent window &mdash; this should register your test as having been completed and generate the certification that is loaded to your profile.


## Professional development training

Our work at CivicActions takes us in new directions every day. In many cases, taking additional training can help everyone on our team better realize our organizational mission. Because external trainings benefit both individuals and our organization, CivicActions has a training budget.

If you’re interested in taking a training related to your role at CivicActions, you’ll need to complete the process outlined in this section to get your request approved. When you find a training opportunity that interests you:

### 1. Make your request

The review and approval processes can take a bit of time, so it’s best if you make your training request as early as possible. Here are some basic guidelines about how far in advance to request training:

* **Two weeks in advance:** If you’re interested in an individual training that costs less than $1,000, doesn’t require travel, and doesn’t involve an outside source of funding.
* **Four weeks in advance:** For individual trainings that cost less than $1,000 and that require travel, are at a conference, or involve an outside source of funding.
* **Six to eight weeks in advance:** For individual or group trainings (or conferences) that cost more than $1,000, or anything involving international travel.


### 2. Create your Individual Development Plan (IDP)

After you’ve made your request, you’ll need to create an [IDP](https://gsa--c.na21.visual.force.com/apex/IDP_HomePage?sfdc.tabName=01rt0000000L2d8) related to the training or conference that you want to attend. The IDP helps you articulate how a given training contributes to your longer-term professional goals. Create it in Salesforce. See the [GSA Guide to IDPs](https://insite.gsa.gov/portal/mediaId/615682/fileName/EmployeesGuide2IndivDevePlan_1113.action) for policy information.

To get some IDP inspiration, you can browse some examples from your CivicActions colleagues, including the approved IDPs of [Leah Bannon](https://drive.google.com/a/gsa.gov/file/d/1Sid8vVFgR69gYOin5FUxbVbuC6XGEu-zIii9dO7xBN4VrWumKvl02Zs0NFKxg_bUGikkSiakn0HBFdlP/view) and [Emileigh Barnes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IDVXKHnj9lVWiloBShZ9tuU3Wwe7ErTUL0hVDncKau4/edit) for General Assembly classes. Gray's [TL;DR on IDPs](https://civicactions.slack.com/archives/distributed/p1447194666000190) is well worth a look.

Here are a few hints for creating a top-notch IDP:

* In the **Series** field, select **0301 - Miscellaneous Administration and Program Services**.
* Leave the **Procurement specialization** field blank unless you are on the operations or acquisitions team and have taken or are pursuing a training in a procurement specialization.
* As you’re writing about your long- and short-term goals, include a few sentences about what the training is about and how it connects to your work at GSA/CivicActions as well as a few sentences about how it will contribute to your overall professional development.
* Add a related objective, an activity (this is where you list the name of the conference/training you want to attend), and a competency.

Once you’ve completed your IDP, submit to your supervisor for review.

If you need to edit your IDP, check out [our guide to updating IDPs](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1o-JMtcXWqnWwRNPB_m8TOc4aYYKRyjR8vdcrS6Wkpt4/edit?pli=1#slide=id.p7). You'll need to clone it, revise it, and place it in “resubmit status.”

### 3. Meet with your supervisor

Once you’ve submitted your IDP,  you’ll meet with your supervisor to discuss it.  Your supervisor will want to make sure your IDP aligns with CivicActions’s organizational goals and your professional development training needs. Once you’ve responded to any feedback your supervisor has provided, ask them to approve your IDP in Salesforce.

CivicActions’s training and travel budget is allocated for each fiscal year based on a projection of our total team size. Allowed annual expenditures for each business unit and chapter are determined by each business unit or chapter’s size relative to CivicActions as a whole; in other words, larger business units will have larger budgets.

That said, CivicActions will consider all requests for training, but it’s the responsibility of heads of chapters and business units to plan spending accordingly. If a particular business unit or chapter exhausts its budget before the end of the fiscal year, the director of operations may have to deny certain training requests.

### 4. Enter your request in the speaking request tracker

Once your IDP is approved, enter your speaking or training request in [our team spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Y0336rKQ4FiTFhoQynRjoVuJFzXEgaV0QcHqaNd-Eis/edit#gid=751771132). Please complete the entire form, except for columns B (supervisor approval), D (presence of red flags), Q (notes), R (identification of red flags), and S (steps to approval).

If you don’t complete all the required columns, there will likely delay the processing of your request.

Within one week of submitting your request, you should hear back from [Pia](mailto: pia.scott@gsa.gov) about the status of your request and whether you have any red flags to resolve.

### 5. Resolve any red flags

Before your request can be approved, it needs to be free of red flags. If [Pia](mailto: pia.scott@gsa.gov) identified any red flags in your request, please resolve them quickly! (To get more details about these red flags, refer to columns D, Q, R, and S in the [OSCIT/CivicActions Speaking Requests / Attending Events](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Y0336rKQ4FiTFhoQynRjoVuJFzXEgaV0QcHqaNd-Eis/edit#gid=2065658991) Google sheet.)

Some of the most common red flags include:

* Conferences (with or without travel)
* Training at conferences (with or without travel)
* Training involving travel
* Any training or conference requiring payment
* Training or conference purchase is over $1,000
* Vendor-sponsored event participation (offers to cover any expense)
* International travel

It’s fairly common for a request to have multiple red flags, but a request can’t be approved until the red flags are resolved.

If your entry is highlighted in yellow, the red flags have not been resolved. If your entry is highlighted green, you’re good to go! Additional steps to work through these issues:


#### Are you attending a conference or traveling for training?

Conferences, training at conferences, and training involving travel require Salesforce approval. [Pia](mailto: pia.scott@gsa.gov) will create this Salesforce Event Approval request, so no action is required on your part. You will receive two email notifications: submission and approval. Further instructions will be provided, based upon the training request type.

#### Does the training or conference require payment?

For training requests that require payment, either a registration fee or tuition, you must submit a purchase request at <https://cap.civicactions.com/>. [Pia](mailto: pia.scott@gsa.gov) will send you an email notification to clear you to make a purchase request via [C2](https://cap.civicactions.com/), and cc <mailto:civicactions-purchasers@gsa.gov> to inform the Ops Team of the approval. Put in your request, including all of the relevant information to ensure Ops can make the purchase. For requests under $1,000, please attach a PDF version of your approved IDP (over $1,000 requires the SF-182 instead). Your request will receive a final review and approval by the director of operations or their designee. Upon their approval, Ops will arrange for payment and ensure you have the information you need for a successful training.

If you’ve never used [C2](https://cap.civicactions.com/) before, request to be set up as an CivicActions user by [creating a ticket](https://cap.civicactions.com/feedback). Your account should be set up within one business day.

In general, if training or conference purchase request is less than $1,000, it can be processed through an CivicActions purchase card. Confirmation of purchase will be used as receipt and no additional document from vendor is needed.

#### Does the training or conference cost over $1,000?

You'll need to complete an SF-182. The SF-182, in addition to being the document that authorizes CivicActions to pay for the training, is also a contract between you and the government. If you leave before terms of this “continuing service agreement” are met, then you are required to pay the government for the cost of the training.

To get this started, you'll need to create [an SF-182 request](https://gsa--c.na21.visual.force.com/apex/IDP_SF182Edit) in Salesforce. Link it to your IDP and also provide your position level.

Then, you can go ahead and [Add new training request to existing SF-182](https://gsa--c.na21.visual.force.com/apex/IDP_SF182RequestEdit). Here, you'll need to provide a little more detail, including:

* Link to SF-182 request that you made above
* Link to Activity created in your IDP
* Vendor
* Course Title
* Training start and end dates
* Training duty hours (# of hours of training taking place during the regular work day)
* Training location
* Training type code, purpose type, delivery type, designation type, and source type (fill in what seems right to you here).
* Tuition and Fee (Direct Cost)
* Books and Materials (Direct Cost)
* Travel Cost (Indirect Cost)
* Per diem (Indirect Cost)
* Supervisor
* Approver 1 (your supervisor's name again)
* Approver 2 is Aaron Snow, but only for trainings costing over $3,000.
* Purchase card holder is Ethan Heppner

Save your SF-182 request when finished. You will be notified automatically when it is approved.

In the meantime, you can request an invoice from the training vendor, which should include all of the information necessary to process an electronic funds transfer (EFT), and complete a purchase request at <https://cap.civicactions.com>. Please upload your invoice as well as your approved SF-182 to the purchase request so that the Operations team may review and approve.

#### Does the event cover registration, lodging, or food free of charge?

If the event host is paying any expenses (transportation, lodging, meals, etc.), then you must complete a [Non-Federal Source Gift Form](https://drive.google.com/a/gsa.gov/file/d/0B9DenuU408s4UHVsNFlqTEFpRGc/view?usp=sharing). Send it to [Pia](mailto: pia.scott@gsa.gov) to attach to your Salesforce Event Approval request.

#### Does your training or conference require travel?

For requests involving travel, [Pia](mailto: pia.scott@gsa.gov) will send confirmation of Salesforce approval to you, your supervisor, Ethan Heppner and <mailto:civicactionstravelauths@gsa.gov>. Upon receipt of confirmation, please submit your Travel Authorization in [Concur](https://travel.gsa.gov/). Be sure to complete Steps 2–6 in the [Complete Guide to Travel at CivicActions](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/14sMYGW2_Js8bnMAWApfD1srAX7H9J5Ydz1ff85A_8LU/edit?pli=1). Once you’ve successfully submitted your Travel Authorization, the CivicActions travel team will review it. If all looks good, your Travel Authorization will be approved.

If this is your first time on government travel, you have some preliminary work to do. To complete the necessary steps before travel, follow the steps to [get set up in Concur](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1C3epcdesOu9VExSnt4A2vGLzb7VQq9uzecqLXn6TyCE/edit).
You will also need to [apply for a travel card](https://insite.gsa.gov/portal/category/530338). It is the required payment method for your government travel expenses, such as lodging, transportation, meals, etc.

#### Does your request require international travel?

International travel requires additional approvals. As mentioned above, make sure that you’ve submitted your request in the [OCSIT/CivicActions Speaking Requests / Training Requests](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Y0336rKQ4FiTFhoQynRjoVuJFzXEgaV0QcHqaNd-Eis/edit#gid=751771132) 6-8 weeks in advance.

Similar to requesting any sort of training involving travel, [Pia](mailto: pia.scott@gsa.gov) will review and identify any red flags and steps for remediation, and then submit a request on your behalf in Salesforce.

International Salesforce Event Approval Requests require extensive review prior to approval, and must be reviewed and approved by your first and second-level supervisors, the HSSO, OGC, OGE, OAS and the GSA Administrator. [Pia](mailto: pia.scott@gsa.gov) will assist you in coordinating this approval process. You must include justification for international travel in your training request. For example, can this training be obtained in the United States? If so, why do you need to travel outside of the country? This question will be asked at every level of review. Be sure to provide a comprehensive justification (such as professional development, collaboration, information gathering, recruitment, etc.).


### 6. Attend your training

And now, the fun part: It’s time for you to attend your conference or training! Once you get back, share what you’ve learned with your teammates. Consider leading a Learn Teach Learn session or a brown bag. You might also draft a blog post to share your learnings with a broader audience.


## Speaking at conferences

If you&rsquo;re interested in speaking at an event &mdash; even if you&rsquo;re doing so in your personal capacity &mdash; please add that event to our [event spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Y0336rKQ4FiTFhoQynRjoVuJFzXEgaV0QcHqaNd-Eis/edit#gid=2065658991). You&rsquo;ll also need to follow [this guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OjxymrHIU1VREv93HrG1sESzyrtx8B2kl_Ey4IL_4xc/edit#heading=h.t8mki1xtcuxz).

## Self-directed study for engineers

Engineering Chapter members: Would you like to pursue a self-directed training option? Would you like to teach yourself a new programming language, read the latest book on software development ideology, or take an online course? You totally can! Please include the request as part of your Individual Development Plan (IDP). If there is any type of cost associated with your training, you will need a to also submit a supervisor-approved (i.e. signed) Standard Form 182. Once you’ve submitted your IDP your Supervisor will usually approve the request within 72 hours, and you will be good to go! Please coordinate with your project to carve out the time, and with your Supervisor to determine the duration, goals, and success markers of self-directed study. Please talk with your Facilitator or Supervisor with any questions, comments, or concerns.
