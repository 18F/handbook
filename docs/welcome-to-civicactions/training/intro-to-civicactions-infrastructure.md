## About Infrastructure

Infrastructure is the blending of skill sets from development (people who build new stuff) and operations (people who are responsible for making sure existing stuff doesn't break). Historically, both in government and in industry, these two teams did not get along because in order for one team to do their job they&rsquo;d often have to block or frustrate the other. Eventually everyone developed better tools and methodologies and today these two disciplines are getting along much better.
