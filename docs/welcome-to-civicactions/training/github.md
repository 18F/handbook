# GitHub

[GitHub](https://github.com) is a publicly accessible place to share and collaborate on (primarily) open source software projects. GitHub interacts with a program on your computer called Git that tracks every change ever made in a software project.

You&rsquo;ve probably already noticed there&rsquo;s a lot happening on GitHub at CivicActions. That&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s so useful! In fact, it&rsquo;s very likely you&rsquo;ll interact with GitHub in _some_ way, even if you&rsquo;re not writing code. The remainder of this post will help you get you squared away with creating your GitHub account and setting up some basic stuff, and will show you some of the ways you might use GitHub, even if it&rsquo;s not committing code.

### 1. Set up your account

### 2. Basics

If you&rsquo;re a developer, you might have very strong feelings about the Right Way to Use Git, but CivicActions doesn&rsquo;t (yet) have One Way of Using Git, so ask your teammates how they work with GitHub.

If you&rsquo;re not a developer or came from a place that didn&rsquo;t use Git, here are some GitHub-related terms you should be familiar with:

- **Repo** is short for repository, or a project on GitHub. Anybody at CivicActions can create repos in the CivicActions organization and you should _always_ create new projects as CivicActions, not as yourself. You can create new repos in GitHub by clicking the + next to your profile picture. Then, choose New Repository and change the owner to CivicActions.

- The **license** on every repo must be Creative Commons 0, or CC0. That&rsquo;s shorthand for Public Domain. CivicActions is  committed to working in the public domain by our own policies.

Once you&rsquo;re a member of the CivicActions organization, you&rsquo;ll have access to many of our repos.  You&rsquo;ll also have at least read-only access to a few of our private repositories. Check with your team on how to interact with a project. In some cases, the repos themselves have information in a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file for guidance.

- A **fork** is a copy of the main project that is fully separate from CivicActions&rsquo;s. You might be asked to fork a repo and work off your own copy, or you might be asked to commit directly to your team&rsquo;s original repo. This is the kind of thing you should ask your teammates about â€” don't make assumptions!

- There are a few exceptions to this, but generally speaking, you will submit any changes to a project through a pull request. A **pull request,** or **PR,** is a way of saying  &ldquo;here are some changes I&rsquo;d like to contribute &rdquo; and letting the repo&rsquo;s owner decide whether to accept (or merge) them or give feedback. Sometimes your pull request will go from your fork to the main project, sometimes from a _branch._ Again, make sure you understand your team&rsquo;s Git workflow.

- Developer, designer, editor, manager: Whatever your role is, you&rsquo;ll want to get used to **filing issues on GitHub.** Issues are a common way of submitting feedback on projects at CivicActions. If filing an issue seems more difficult for some reason, head to Slack. Or vice versa.

- You may find it helpful to bookmark the repos, issues, and pull request pages you access frequently.

### 3. Working with GitHub

You can use GitHub for almost anything, but consider the resources available to partners or other stakeholders before deciding to use it. Are your partners used to using GitHub? Will they need to create accounts and jump through hoops? Can they even access it from their computers? These are the kinds of things we consider when deciding if GitHub is the right thing to use.

// GOOD IDEA Most projects/repositories have a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file in their root directory that explains how the team invites people to contribute to the project. They might prefer chats over pull requests, for example.

Another pro tip: Search the existing issues before you add one. It may make more sense to comment on that issue rather than create a new one.

To submit an issue, Log in, find the appropriate repo on GitHub, and click the Issues tab in the right column. Then, click the New Issue button. Your issue should have a title and explainer text. You&rsquo;ll probably know what to put there, but teams sometimes have guidance on how to format issues or things to include.

Final pro tip: If your project wants issues formatted in a specific way, you can add an issue template file.
