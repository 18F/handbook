# Meetings and Meeting Tools

Here, you'll find a list of tools folks at CivicActions use to schedule meetings, along with information about some specific meetings at CivicActions.

# <a id="general-meetings">General meetings</a>

## <a id="your-own">Your own</a>

Remember that you can book time on your own calendar. We recommend blocking off your own "free" time in two-to-four hour chunks to complete tasks.

Also, if you're planning a meeting, be sure to state your goal -- what the meeting is and what it isn't -- in an agenda.

## <a id="all-hands">All hands</a>

Our weekly all-hands call includes everyone across CivicActions, and it's how the team disseminates news, updates, and congratulations. It takes place on Mondays at 10am PST. You aren't required to attend the all hands, but you are strongly encouraged to -- it's where big announcements are made, and attending is a great way to put names to faces. The agenda is posted beforehand in [#announcements](https://civicactions.slack.com/announcements) and chatter during and following the call happens in [#ahc](https://civicactions.slack.com/ahc). You can submit ideas for future all-hands calls on the [All Hands Call (AHC) Planning Trello board](https://trello.com/b/Yj3XOSWD/all-hands-call-ahc-planning).

## <a id="daily-scrum">Daily Scrum Calls</a>

Daily scrum calls are project-specific meetings. These short meetings are a scrum ritual for shared storytelling. Standups _usually_ take this form:

- **Y**(esterday): I did this thing.
- **T**(oday): I plan to do this other thing.
- **B**(lockers): This is currently or potentially inhibiting me from doing what I'd like to do.

For more specific information, see [Daily Scrum Calls](https://github.com/CivicActions/agile-baseline/blob/master/03-process/practices/daily-scrum-calls.md).

## <a id="retrospectives">Retrospectives</a>

Another project-specific meeting is the retrospective (called a retro, for short). This usually happens at the end of a sprint and takes between 30 minutes to an hour.

The idea behind the retro is pretty simple: This meeting provide an opportunity for the team to reflect on how it's working. Like standups, retros are another project-governance meeting.

For more specific information on Retrospectives, see [Sprint Retrospectives](https://github.com/CivicActions/agile-baseline/blob/master/03-process/practices/sprint-retrospectives.md).

## <a id="sprint-planning">Sprint planning</a>

The last project-specific meeting is sprint planning. Sprint planning takes many forms at CivicActions, but the goal is to come together to decide what to do (and how to estimate the work being done) during an upcoming sprint.

For more specific information, see [Sprint Planning Meetings](https://github.com/CivicActions/agile-baseline/blob/master/03-process/practices/sprint-planning-meetings.md).

# <a id="meetings-tools">Tools</a>

Here's an overview of how CivicActions uses specific tools to facilitate meetings.

## <a id="google-calendar">Google Calendar</a>

**CivicActions uses shared calendars** in [Google Calendar](/google-calendar) for CivicActions standing meetings, birthdays, and "out of office" time.

**You can specify which hours you work.** From the guide: "About a third of the way down the 'General' settings' page there's a section called 'Working hours' and a checkbox that's unchecked by default. If you check it, you can specify your preferred working hours. Once you save your changes, other people will get a warning if they try to schedule you outside those times."

**You can see other people's public calendars to help schedule meetings.** To view someone else's calendar, type their name in the lefthand column under "other calendars." Finally, there's a link titled "Find a time" (left of what's shown in the gif, below) which shows everyone's schedules next to each other so you can easily see when there are no conflicts.

**You can set up blocks of time that people can reserve.** Just select "Appointment slots" after you choose a window of time.

For more information on how we use Google Calendar, see [Basic Communication Tools](../../how-we-work/tools/basic-communication-tools.md#google-calendar).


## <a id="doodle">Doodle</a>

People occasionally use [Doodle](http://www.doodle.com/) to send out meeting-time surveys. If you're flexible on when you want your meeting to start, it's a great idea to send out a Doodle and poll attendees on what times work for them.

## <a id="google-hangouts">Google Hangouts</a>

[Google Hangouts](/google-hangouts) are video chats in the browser. Here are some tips for using Hangouts:

- **You can add a Google Hangout to a meeting invite** by clicking "Add video call" on the event management page.
- **You can also start or share a hangout from Slack** by typing `/hangout`.
- **GSA IT has disabled chat for CivicActions while using Google Hangouts.** We use Slack with Google Hangouts to send links and images.
- **You can dial people into a Hangout.** A Hangout's "invite" dialog can generate a phone number that people can call.
- Use screensharing for demos and for pairing.

## <a id="remote-tools">Screensharing tools</a>

Federal employees use a range of different video software to communicate. Check with your agency partner for preferences. Some common programs:

- [Google Hangouts](/google-hangouts)
- Adobe Connect
- Talky.io
- Join.me (if you need an account, talk to [kathryn](https://civicactions.slack.com/messages/@kathryn/))

## Set up a conference line

Use [Meeting Space](/gsa-tools-equipment-and-transit/#meeting-space).

## <a id="ios-recording">Recording iOS 8+ devices</a>

 We can record iOS 8+ devices by connecting via lightning connector and then starting a QuickTime new movie recording. To record, you have to change the audio and video input devices.
