# Telephone Use

- There are times when a phone call in may also be necessary, such as when Wi-Fi is not available or to call in to Zoom
- Don't rely on speaker feature, but have a headset handy
- You may need to be called into a Google Hangout if you can't attend the video meeting
- Sharing your phone number with the client/PO is optional
