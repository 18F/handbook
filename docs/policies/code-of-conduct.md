# Code of Conduct

## <a name="general-guideline"></a>General Guidelines

Successful operation of CivicActions requires that all of us be respectful of, and open with, one another. This is a community of trust and it needs straight-forward, non-critical dialogue to accomplish its goals. There's little that can't be resolved with honest appraisal and an attitude of cooperation. We don't compete here, and we try really hard to avoid back-biting and complaining.

That's not to say we don't annoy or otherwise drive each other a little nuts occasionally. It happens. If an issue is not easily resolved, there is a "Complaint Resolution Policy" in "Required Stuff" below.

## <a name="confident"></a>Confidentiality

This paragraph is simply intended to alert employees to the need for discretion and is not intended to inhibit normal business communications. For further information, refer to the "Confidential Information and Inventions Agreement" you signed when you were hired.

## <a name="outside-activity"></a>Outside Activities

You may engage in outside employment or personal educational activities during non-working hours, provided that such activities do not interfere with your job performance or constitute a conflict of interest.

## <a name="code-conduct"></a>Code of Conduct

Within a virtual working environment communication is vital to keeping a collaborative, healthy and fun atmosphere. We want to foster an open, inclusive, and diverse culture with the freedom to be ourselves. With that in mind we also want to ensure that everyone here is treated fairly and also feels safe and welcome. We have a variety of communication tools and forums, including Slack, Hangouts, and in-person events, and the code of conduct is intended for all of them.

CivicActions is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, age, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form and employees who violate this code of conduct may be subject to disciplinary actions.

Be mindful. Having a diverse team means that we will have different opinions, viewpoints and experiences. This also means that we may not agree on what is humorous, insulting or rude. We all stand to learn from each other and that includes gaining awareness to how others perceive certain communications. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Be friendly and welcoming. As our team grows, we are more likely to have peers that we don't directly work with. We all have an opportunity to be friendly in other arenas to get to know each other, including retreats, pod calls, and social slack channels. Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of the company.

Be considerate and respectful. We all have a voice and some of us happen to be louder than others.
When in a discussion or sharing a thought, think before you speak, and give others a chance to be heard. When disagreeing about something, focus on resolving issues constructively and ask for help when needed.

If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct, please speak to your manager or Henry Poole.

## <a name="equal-opportunities"></a>Equal Employment Opportunities

CivicActions provides equal employment opportunities to "all qualified people". What that means can be found under "Required Stuff" below.

## <a name="equal-employment"></a>Equal Employment - Expanded Definition

CivicActions provides equal employment opportunities and administers all aspects and conditions of employment without regard to race, religion, color, gender, sexual orientation, pregnancy, age, national origin, ancestry, physical or mental disability, severe/morbid obesity, medical condition, military or veteran status, genetic information, marital status, ethnicity, alienage or any other protected classification, in accordance with applicable federal, state, and local laws. CivicActions takes allegations of discrimination, intimidation, harassment and retaliation very seriously and will promptly conduct an investigation when warranted.

Equal employment opportunity includes, but is not limited to, employment, training, promotion, demotion, transfer, leaves of absence, and termination.

## <a name="personappearance"></a>Personal Appearance

Be appropriate for the client you are meeting either face-to-face or via video conferencing. If you have any questions, you should contact your manager for suggestions.

## <a name="complaint-resolution"></a>Complaint Resolution Policy

CivicActions subscribes to an open door policy. If an issue arises that cannot be worked out directly, you are encouraged to bring a particular complaint to your manager for resolution. When matters cannot be handled on an informal basis, CivicActions has established a formal procedure for a fair review of any work related controversy, dispute or misunderstanding, including intimidation, harassment or bullying. We have a zero tolerance policy concerning those behaviors and, actually, can't imagine them ever happening here.

A complaint may be brought by one or more employees concerning any work-related problem where the complaint has not been satisfactorily resolved in an informal manner.

Step 1 - The complaint must be submitted in writing to management or within 3 working days of an incident. A written request for a meeting must be submitted simultaneously. Generally, a meeting will be held within 3 working days of the employee's request. Witnesses will be allowed as necessary. If the problem is not resolved during this meeting management will give the employee a written resolution within 3 working days. If the employee is not satisfied, the employee may proceed to Step 2.

Step 2 - If the employee is not satisfied after Step 1, the employee may submit a written request for review of the complaint and Step 2 solution to the CEO or appointed representative. Such a request must be made within 3 working days following the receipt of the Step 1 resolution. The CEO or appointed representative will review the complaint and proposed solution and may call a further meeting to explore the problem. This meeting is to be attended by the employee concerned, the employee's immediate manager, and any other employee of CivicActions whom the aggrieved employee chooses. The CEO or appointed representative will render the final decision within 10 working days after receiving the Step 2 request. The decision will be given to the employee in writing and will become part of the employee's personnel file.

## <a name="corrective"></a>Corrective Action

A high level of job performance and ethical behavior is expected of you.

In the event that your job performance does not meet the standards established for your position, you should seek assistance from your manager to attain an acceptable level of performance. If you fail to respond to or fail to make positive efforts toward improvement, corrective action may ensue.

If you violate established Company procedures, guidelines, or exhibit behavior that violates CivicActions' standards of honesty and integrity or creates an appearance of impropriety, CivicActions may elect to administer disciplinary action.

## <a name="irregularity"></a>Reporting Irregularities

It is the responsibility of each employee of CivicActions to report to a member of the management team any irregularities indicating actual or suspected existence of a loss, fraud, embezzlement or similar impairment of funds or property, or other suspicious activity.

## <a name="conflict-interest"></a>Conflict of Interest

You know and share the values of our culture here, with an emphasis on integrity and transparency, and conflict of interest will not often be an issue, if ever. But, if you question the propriety of a transaction or activity that involves CivicActions or employees/contractors of CivicActions, or a client, or if an outside activity you may be considering raises questions in your mind, talk to your manager or one of the management team.

### Creating a Culture of Innovation

We aspire to create a culture where people work joyfully, communicate openly about things that matter, and provide great services for the American people and the world. We would like our team and our communities (including government and private sector colleagues) to reflect the diversity of America. We want to foster diversity of all kindsâ€”not just the classes protected in law. Diversity fosters innovation. Diverse teams are creative teams. We need a diversity of perspective to create solutions for the real and urgent challenges we face.

This is the 18F Code of Conduct. We follow all Equal Employment Opportunity laws, and our expectations are higher. We expect everyone we work with to adhere to the [GSA Anti-harassment Policy](http://www.gsa.gov/portal/directive/d0/content/512516), even if they do not work for the General Services Administration. We expect everyone who works at 18F, attends 18F events and meetings, or participates in online forums or other virtual collaboration to follow this code of conduct and the laws and policies mentioned above. This applies to all of our methods of communication: office chatrooms, commit messages, email, and both formal and informal conversation.

### Be Empowering

Consider what you can do to encourage and support others. Make room for quieter voices to contribute. Offer support and enthusiasm for great ideas. Leverage the low cost of experimentation to support your colleagues' ideas, and take care to acknowledge the original source, not just the most recent or loudest contributor. When someone offers something unexpected, look for ways you can contribute and collaborate. Share your knowledge and skills. Prioritize access for and input from those who are traditionally excluded from the civic process.

### Boundaries

Create boundaries to your own behavior and consider how you can create safe space that helps prevent unacceptable behavior by others. We do not seek to list all cases of unacceptable behavior, but provide examples to help guide our community in thinking through how to respond when we experience these types of behavior, whether directed at ourselves or others.

If you are unsure if something is appropriate behavior, it probably isn't. Each person you interact with can define where that line is for them. *Impact matters more than intent.* Ensuring that your behavior does not have a negative impact is your responsibility. Problems happen when we assume that our way of thinking or behaving is the norm or ok with everyone. This is particularly problematic when we are in a position of power or privilege.

Here are a few examples of unacceptable behavior:

* Negative or offensive remarks based on the protected classes as listed in the [GSA Anti-harassment Policy](http://www.gsa.gov/portal/directive/d0/content/512516) of race, religion, color, sex (with or without sexual conduct and including pregnancy and sexual orientation involving transgender status/gender identity, and sex-stereotyping), national origin, age, disability (physical or mental), genetic information, sexual orientation, gender identity, parental status, marital status, and political affiliation **as well as** gender expression, mental illness, socioeconomic status or background, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, or clothing. **Consider that calling attention to differences can feel alienating.**

* Touching people without their affirmative consent.

* Sustained disruption of meetings, talks, or discussions, including chatrooms.

* Patronizing language or behavior.

* Aggressive and micro-aggressive behavior, such as unconstructive criticism, providing corrections that do not improve the conversation (sometimes referred to as "well actually"s), repeatedly interrupting or talking over someone else, feigning surprise at someone's lack of knowledge or awareness about a topic, or subtle prejudice (for example, comments like "That's so easy my grandmother could do it.").

* Referring to people in a way that misidentifies their gender and/or rejects the validity of their gender identity; for instance by using incorrect pronouns or forms of address (misgendering).

* Retaliating against anyone who files a formal complaint that someone has violated these codes or laws.
