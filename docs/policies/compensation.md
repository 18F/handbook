## <a name="pay-period"></a>Pay Periods

The standard workweek for CivicActions is 12:01 a.m. Sunday through midnight the following Saturday. This is only important if you’re a non-exempt employee who is eligible for overtime.

We have semi-monthly pay days. The first pay period is from the first through the fifteenth of the month and the second from the sixteenth through the end of the month.

Paychecks are direct deposited on the 25th day of the month for the first pay period, and on the 10th day of the following month for the second. If the 10th or 25th fall on a Saturday, Sunday or holiday, you will be paid on the preceding business day.

## <a name="overtimepay"></a>Overtime

Any overtime needs to be pre-approved by a manager or member of the management team.

CivicActions complies with all applicable laws regarding payment of overtime work. Overtime is based on the laws of the state in which the employee lives and, as of this writing, our only non-exempt employees are New Yorkers. Information about other states will be added as needed.

New York: overtime is paid at the rate of 1-1/2 times the regular rate of pay for hours worked over 40 in a payroll week

There are no schedules or guaranteed cost of living or salary adjustments.

## <a name="mileage"></a>Mileage Reimbursement

CivicActions will reimburse employees at the IRS “business standard mileage rate” for miles traveled by the employee in the employee’s car while on CivicActions’ business.

DON’T WE USE HARVEST FOR THIS NOW?
CivicActions will timely reimburse business-related out-of-pocket expenses as long as you submit a receipt. For multiple expenses, e.g., a business trip, we also will need an expense report which can be found at:
