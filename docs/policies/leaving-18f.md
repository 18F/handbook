title: Leaving 18F
---

This guide covers the offboarding policy and process.

## How to resign

### 1. Email your resignation letter

If you decide you want to leave 18F, send an official email to your supervisor and [leaving18f@gsa.gov](mailto:leaving18f@gsa.gov).

Include your termination date, which should be at least two weeks out. Your last day at 18F cannot be a federal holiday.

### 2. Complete the clearance checklist

Complete the [employee clearance checklist](https://drive.google.com/a/gsa.gov/file/d/0B2b-_CCBBYvRNGNVWTRjUnpmTVNtUUR6clVJdUt2MFVTNm5j/view?usp=sharing) with [#teamops](https://18f.slack.com/archives/teamops).

### 3. Review benefits paperwork

Review your [benefits options](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fuPxdhSY4YCYQvTFhjmjtLpRK8_ophZnFA9hsK8zftA/edit).

You should also review the [FERS refund information](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TiFdQ-2pyrmib3Zsh1GDGeWorM7F-cbxk1u-82zX0Aw/edit) and [Form SF 3106](https://drive.google.com/a/gsa.gov/file/d/0B4J4Dpr2HVDsMnpEQnc1ZHI0RkVadjVOZGZhOTVKMVZyUktN/view) before your last day.

If you have any questions, please contact [Marty Sanchez-Lowery](mailto:martha.sanchez-lowery@gsa.gov).

### 4. Return your equipment

When you leave 18F, you are responsible for returning all 18F issued equipment. Failure to do so may lead to your final paycheck being withheld until the equipment is returned.

## Offboarding process

`Duplicate` the `Template` in the [Off-Boarding Tasks](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IlFY5AAvTyuS7yDHk5_odJGHYZDU_MN9HNGKJ2zXwi0/edit#gid=0) to make a checklist. More detail for certain tasks is below. Note that, per GSA policy, the "technical offboardings" (access to any work system) need to happen within 24 hours of the person ending their work at GSA.

### Supervisor

- Work with the employee to transition the employee's workload to other team members.
- Ensure they complete their last timesheet in Tock.

### Talent Team

- Conduct an exit interview using [these questions](https://docs.google.com/a/gsa.gov/document/d/1PpbxoZhPlW2oQx9grMyPSUDepDTQCNiwYO-D1X2IkJk/edit).
  - Documentation will be kept anonymous.
  - After three samples are gathered, look for trends.

### Ops Team

- Complete the [clearance checklist](https://drive.google.com/a/gsa.gov/file/d/0B2b-_CCBBYvRNGNVWTRjUnpmTVNtUUR6clVJdUt2MFVTNm5j/view?usp=sharing) with the employee.
