If you're traveling for 18F during your first two weeks (normally for orientation, if you're based in a city that doesn't have an 18F office), you'll get your travel arranged for you by 18F's travel team. Here's what you need to do to get set up for that:

1. First thing that you’ll need to get is a **“travel vendor ID”**. You can do this by filling out [the EFT form](https://drive.google.com/a/gsa.gov/file/d/0B0Kck5dqF_Ebb0FFZ29RR0JmVVk/view?usp=sharing).

   _Note if you haven't started and don't have your GSA email address yet_:

   Your access to the EFT form linked above may be restricted, so you should have received it as an attachment in your welcome email-- feel free to reach out to [18f-travel@gsa.gov](mailto:18f-travel@gsa.gov) if you never got it.

   _Note if you have started and do have your GSA email address_:

   Yes, you probably already filled out the EFT form at orientation, so this seems repetitive. However, there is a good reason for it. [Click here to find out why](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cHGnvUVGzYJkSuW0-2ZEy4g4vwgNLLkZcI1j5JVozDQ/edit#bookmark=id.f206jlg5swxh).

2.  **Attach your completed EFT form** to [this pre-populated email](https://mail.google.com/mail/?view=cm&ui=2&tf=0&fs=1&to=kc-vendor.number.requests%40gsa.gov&su=Request%20to%20Obtain%20Employee%20ID&body=To%20KC%20Vendor%2C%0A%0ACould%20I%20please%20have%20my%20employee%20ID%3F%0A%0AThank%20you%2C%0A) and send.

3. **Wait for a reply to your email.**
   You’ll get a number like **E000xxxxx** in the reply, which is important for the next step.

4. Send Employee ID to [18f-travel@gsa.gov](mailto:18f-travel@gsa.gov) with:
    * **Full Name** as it appears on ID, as per TSA requirements.
    * **Date of birth**, also for TSA requirements.
    * **Personal email**, for account setup until you take the IT Security Awareness Training.
    * **Phone Number**, for airline requirements and to facilitate booking
    * **Origin and Destination Airports or Train Stations**, for obvious reasons
    * **Approved Dates of Travel**, including approximate times if possible
    * **A good time for the 18F travel team to call you** in order to set up flights. The travel team's hours of operation         are Monday through Friday from 9 AM to 7 PM Eastern time.

5. **Confirm travel**: Once you’ve sent in all of your information, one of the members of the 18F travel team will reach out to you by phone about potential travel options.

6. **Get tickets**: E-tickets will be sent to the email address that you provided. Once a reservation is made, you will get a “pending” itinerary, which will be finalized, depending on the airline, no later than 72 hours before departure.

7. **Book hotels** Until you can get a GSA travel card (read more about this [here](https://handbook.18f.gov/first-time-travel-travel-card/)), you will unfortunately have to pay for your lodging and all other travel expenses upfront. But with a valid receipt, you will get reimbursed! Just make sure to stay at a place with rates under the government maximum (also known as per diem). You can look up what that is [here](http://www.gsa.gov/portal/category/100120).

   The recommended resource for booking hotels as a Federal government employee is [Fedrooms.com](http://fedrooms.com).

   You may, however, choose to book a hotel directly or through an alternative service if those alternatives are “advantageous to the government” -- meaning either less expensive or closer to your work site(s) than the options available on Fedrooms. Whatever option you choose, however, must be "fire safe" and fully refundable up to 24 hours before departure.

8. **Travel!** And keep receipts

   You _will_ need receipts for the following types of expenses

      * Hotels

      * Taxis + tips paid to drivers (limited to origins and destinations involving workplaces, residences/hotels, and airports/transit stations)

      * Public transit tickets/pass

      * Baggage fees

      * Parking at the airport

      * Any other expense related to getting you from your residence or hotel to your worksite(s) and back.

   You _don’t_ need receipts for the following:

      * Food and beverages

      * Entertainment and other non-work related expenses

      * Tips for porters, etc.

      * Incidentals, forgotten items, etc.

   The above expenses are accounted for in your M&IE per diem rate, which you’ll receive as a flat sum after you submit a voucher for reimbursement. You can look this up this nightly allowance [here](http://www.gsa.gov/portal/category/100120), on the same page as where you looked up the government maximum hotel rate.

9. After you return, **create a voucher for reimbursement**:

   You can apply to be reimbursed for your travel expenses as soon as your return from your trip and have full access to Concur. Once you have completed the IT Security Awareness and Privacy Act trainings in OLU, you can apply for access to Concur by completing the [CGE Access Request Form](https://drive.google.com/a/gsa.gov/file/d/0B0Kck5dqF_EbM3ZRaHRqRHFWSzA/view?usp=sharing) and sending it to [18f-travel@gsa.gov](mailto:18f-travel@gsa.gov).

   Once you get access, you can follow [these instructions for how to complete a voucher](https://handbook.18f.gov/travel-guide-5-reimbursement/). Feel free to reach out in #travel and request to set up a 30 minute crash course in how to use Concur if anything seems confusing.


### Having trouble sending the EFT form?
If this link does not automatically open up a gmail window for the the Employer request, please email:  [kc-vendor.number.requests@gsa.gov](mailto:kc-vendor.number.requests@gsa.gov) and in the body of your message, ask for an Employee ID. Be sure to attach your completed EFT form.

### What happens if my flight gets cancelled?

The easiest option is to have your airline reschedule you. If that's not possible or timely, you may also call Ad-Trav at *(877) 472-6716* to be rebooked on any airline.

If you are traveling to orientation and are worried that you will miss it because of delays or cancellations, please let [shawnique.muller@gsa.gov](mailto:shawnique.muller@gsa.gov) know and she will make arrangements for you to swear in when you expect to arrive. You may have to attend GSA orientation in your home city 2 weeks later, but please continue to travel to the office where your orientation was scheduled to be for 18F onboarding.

While Shawnique and the travel team won't be available until Monday if your cancellation occurs over the weekend, please feel comfortable rebooking your travel either though the airline or via Ad-Trav, and rest assured that you will be in good hands when you arrive at 18F.
