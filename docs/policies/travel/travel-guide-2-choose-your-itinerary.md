#### Choose a flight
The government has a number of contracts with airlines to receive special rates. You must **first try to book a flight offered by one of the govt. contract carriers and includes 3 stars.**

If you cannot use one of these flights, you must justify why you are choosing a non-contact carrier and fare.

You can filter flights by contract type and airline, but consider that a non-contract fare may be cheaper.

[What justifies using a non-contract fare?](/travel-guide-faq/#non-contract)

* Select **View Fares** to view additional itinerary details

* Have booked your travel through [AdTrav](/travel-guide-faq/#adtrav).

If this is not the case, please go back up to the [Book in Concur Section](#book-hotel-in-Concur).
