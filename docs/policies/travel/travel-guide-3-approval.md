Now that you've chosen your itinerary, its time to complete some additional trip information to get your trip ready for approval and to book your tickets. There are 3 parts to this process:

1. [Completing your Trip Information](#i-complete-trip-information)

2. [Entering Accounting Codes](#iii-enter-accounting-codes)

3. [Submit your Authorization for Approval](#iv-submit-authorization-for-approval)

### I. Complete Trip Information
On the **Trip Booking Information** page you must enter some general information. TeamOps has standardized the trip naming convention to alleviate some billing headaches.

Enter the following trip information on this page:
<img src="/images/travel/12-trip-name.png" class="travel-guide-hide" alt="Trip Booking Information screen">

1. **Trip name:** Follow the naming convention below:

    * BILLABLE/NON-BILLABLE: [Exact name of Tock Project] you are billing against, # of [tock project ID](http://tock.18f.gov/projects).

    * Example: NON-BILLABLE: Ops/ Admin #3

2. **Trip description:** Brief summary of the purpose of the trip.

3. **WIll this travel be a detail to another location?** No.

4. **Trip Purpose:** “Mission (Operational)” in most cases, but occasionally “Conference” or “Training”.

Proceed by clicking **Next** to finalize the reservation.

You will now see final reservation. Review all of the details and hit **“Confirm booking”** when done.

#### Additional step if you booked out of Concur
**Note** If you did not book a hotel from concur, please justify why you are not using a hotel.

Notice the second block of red text. It indicated that the reservations MUST be approved by a certain time (usually by the end of that day). It’s critical that you finish Steps 4 and 5 within that time frame.

Proceed to enter your accounting codes.

### II. Fill in general information

1. Click on the **General** tab of your authorization.
1. Select the **Document Information** tab.
1. For **Type Code**, select "SINGLE TRIP".
1. Click **Save**.

### III. Enter Accounting Codes
You will now be taken to your newly created "Authorization" Summary. This process will allow the #travel team to review your itinerary and approve your travel.

**Bill your travel to the right organization.**

In order for travel to be billed to the right account, you need to enter an accounting code for all of the types of travel that you do at 18F.

#### 1. Verify your accounting codes
Click on the **Accounting** tab of your authorization. [_Having Trouble?_](#having-trouble)

_Most 18F staff should have 2 accounting codes* here: one billable and one non-billable representing their line of business at 18F (i.e. Client Services, C3CO etc.)._

Accounting codes have a number of fields, but there are really only three components that interest us here:

* **BBFY (Fiscal Year):** Fiscal Year in which travel will occur.
i.e. all travel starting between Oct. 1st, 2015 and Sept. 30th, 2016 will be 2016

* **Organization Codes:** Line of business at 18F
i.e. Consulting, Client Services, etc.

* **Activity Codes:** Billable v. Non-Billable activity

##### When/why might I not have 2 accounting codes?

* **More than 2 accounting. codes?** Yes, if you are involved in multiple lines of business (i.e. client services who also does consulting)

* **Only one accounting code?** Business Ops for the moment is strictly non-billable.

* **No Codes?** You haven’t created any yet! [Add some codes](/travel-guide-accounting-codes/#create-accounting-codes).

#### 2. Select a code
* Click on the blue label link of the code to add it to your authorization

* Are you splitting a trip between two different accounting codes? (i.e. making a trip that is partially billable and partially non-billable?) Check out this how-to guide [here](/travel-guide-accounting-codes/#multiple-accounting-codes).

#### 3. (Optional) Set your default code
If most of your work is either Billable or non-Billable, you can choose a default, by checking the boxes under Document Default and Default LOA corresponding to your accounting code. They’ll automatically show up on every authorization.

#### 4. Verify you've select the right codes
If you've verified that you've selected the correct codes,

[Proceed to Submit Authorization for Approval](#iv-submit-authorization-for-approval)

#### Having Trouble
**What is an authorization?** Steps 1-3 cover the process of getting an authorization, which is simply the formal approval from your supervisor for travel, including a review and booking of major expenses such as flights and hotels.

If you've navigated away from your authorization, you can find it from the **Home** page, scroll down to the **Recent Authorization** and click **Edit**

### IV. Submit Authorization for Approval
You're getting really close! You can almost feel the TSA X-ray scan! One last step before it's travel time! In this step, you will send your authorization to be approved by the 18F travel team.


1. Navigate to the **Perform Pre-Audits** Tab for your authorization. This is a tool to to check your authorization to make sure you haven’t missed anything.

    * You will now see a list of all the items that might cause a fail or hardfail for the trip to be approved.

    * Any _HARDFAIL_ must be corrected before the submission of the authorization-- i.e. accounting codes must be added. Likely causes for _HARDFAILS_ are the lack of accounting codes. If you are seeing this fail, please go back up to the [Enter Accounting Codes section of this guide](#iii-enter-accounting-codes).

    *  Likely _FAILS_ arise when non-government contract flight was selected in [Choosing a flight 2](/travel-guide-2-choose-your-itinerary/#choose-a-flight) or if your booked a hotel outside of Concur. An authorization with a _FAIL_ may still be submitted, but should be justified in some way. For example, the choice of flight may be justified if there were no government contract flights available or if a non-contract fare was less expensive.

3. Correct your or justify failures. To justify a _FAIL_, you may either add an explanation after clicking Justify Pre-Audit Results, or via email to 18Ftravelauths@gsa.gov.

4. Click **Document Actions -> Submit Document** (in the upper right hand corner of your authorization)

5. Stamping
   * You will be taken to a document history page. If your **“Status to Apply”** is **“Submit to Approver”**, then click **Stamp and Submit Document** at either the top or the bottom of the page and continue. If not, please correct any other failures.

   * The next page will show you your pre-audit results again, in case you missed that step. If nothing is awry, go ahead and click **Continue Stamping the Document.**

   * It doesn’t look like it, but when you see **Close Post Stamping Document Closure Screen**, you are done!

Your authorization has been submitted. You don’t even have to click the button again (but you can if you want).

If there was a problem, Ethan Heppner or Victor Valdiviezo will reach out and make sure you can get everything right before you leave. Otherwise, assume your request will be processed, and if everything was right, you will be approved within one business day.

Once you have been approved **look for an e-mail from Concur confirming the purchase of your tickets and/or hotel.**

#### Whooo you are ready to go!
