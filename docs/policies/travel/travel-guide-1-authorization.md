If you have ended up on this page, it means that you have already run through the [First-Time Travel Guide](/first-time-travel-concur-check) and the substeps to

* [Obtain your vendor ID](/first-time-travel-concur-check)

* [Get a travel card (in some cases you might not need this)](/first-time-travel-travel-card)

* [Complete Concur Profile](/first-time-travel-complete-concur-profile)

To see what sort of authorization, please answer if your project manager has confirmed your travel dates?

[Yes - I am ready to Choose my Itinerary](/travel-guide-2-choose-your-itinerary)

No - Complete the Email Authorization Below

## Step 1 Confirm your travel dates and get travel approval

**Before you go anywhere for 18F,** you will need to provide an authorization email for each instance of travel.

In the case of billable travel, you will need an email of approval from the client.

In the case of non-billable travel, you will need an email of approval from your supervisor (or from the supervisor of whichever division of 18F will be paying for your travel).

18F supervisors themselves no longer have blanket approval and must get it from Aaron Snow or Joshua Bailes.

1. Send an email to your client with the following information:

    **Subject:** [BILLABLE/NON-BILLABLE] - [Tock Project Name] - #[Tock Project ID] -- [Departure_Date] - [Return Date]

    **Body:**

    Hello,

    I request approval to travel from [ home_location ] to [ work_location ].  The dates of travel are [ departure_date ] - [ return_date ].  I will depart the [ departure_date ], to arrive in time for [ work_to_be_done ] scheduled for [ first_day_of_travel_work_date ].  I will return to [ home_location ] on [ return_date ].

    Please reply with your approval, or with any subsequent clarifications you may have.

    Many thanks,

    [ requestor_name ]

2. **BEFORE YOU HIT SEND:**
    * Double-check to make sure you have satisfied all of the above criteria before hitting “send”!

    * Missing anything is grounds for delay as the 18F travel team will ask you to clarify and correct before approving your trip in Concur.

    * Rules are different when certain exceptions apply. If any of the cases below apply to you, please adjust your email accordingly:

    * **What if my client requires that I send a travel budget?** Break the budget down by line items. Notice Wifi is included!

    * **What if I want to get approval for my whole team to travel?** Indicate “Group” in the subject line of the message so we know that multiple folks are covered. For example: "Group Billable / [Project ID] / [Travel Dates]"

    * [What if, for personal reasons,  I want to extend my travel beyond my work dates (i.e. stay in DC for the weekend)?](/travel-guide-faq/#extend-travel)

    * [What if I am traveling from or to another city that is not my home city?](/travel-guide-faq/#multi-city)


## 6. Forward your approval email.
Once you have all necessary approvals, and only then, please forward your approval email to [18ftravelauths@gsa.gov](mailto:18ftravelauths@gsa.gov).

**Are you traveling in the next 3 days?**

[Yes - I need AdTrav](#AdTrav)

[No - I need to book an upcoming trip that will start later than 3 days. Go to normal booking.](/travel-guide-2-choose-your-itinerary)
