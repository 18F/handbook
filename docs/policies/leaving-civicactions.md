# Leaving CivicActions

## <a name="at-will"></a>At-Will Employment

All employment with CivicActions is “at will”. The relationship can be terminated by the employee or by CivicActions at any time, for any or no reason, and without notice. But being who we are, we typically work together for a smooth transition.

## <a name="resig"></a>Resignation

Employees are asked to provide a minimum of 2 weeks written notice of their intent to resign (if possible). The notice should be submitted to the employee’s manager or to someone on the management team.  An exit interview may be requested.

## <a name="termin"></a>Termination

If CivicActions sees a problem with an employee’s performance, or there is otherwise clearly a bad fit between the employee and CivicActions, every effort will be made to remedy the issue(s). If termination turns out to be the only solution the employee will be fully aware of, and probably in agreement with, the reasons.

## <a name="company-property"></a>Return of Company Property

Any company property issued to employees, such as documents, computer equipment or company credit cards, must be returned to CivicActions at the time of separation.

COBRA

If you or your covered dependents lose eligibility for regular, TriNet group medical, dental, vision benefits and/or healthcare FSA, you may be eligible to continue your coverage under COBRA. COBRA allows you to continue receiving these benefits on a temporary basis in certain situations where coverage under the TriNet Benefits Plan would otherwise end. COBRA coverage is explained in greater detail in the Benefits Guidebook.
