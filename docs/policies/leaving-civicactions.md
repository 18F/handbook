# <a name="employseparation"></a>EMPLOYMENT SEPARATION


## <a name="at-will"></a>At-Will Employment
All employment with CivicActions is “at will”. The relationship can be terminated by the employee or by CivicActions at any time, for any or no reason, and without notice. But being who we are, we typically work together for a smooth transition.


## <a name="resig"></a>Resignation
Employees are asked to provide a minimum of 2 weeks written notice of their intent to resign. The notice should be submitted to the employee’s manager or to one of the management team.  An exit interview may be requested.


## <a name="termin"></a>Termination
If CivicActions sees a problem with an employee’s performance, or there is otherwise clearly a bad fit between the employee and CivicActions, every effort will be made to remedy the issue(s). (See “Corrective Action” below). If termination turns out to be the only solution the employee will be fully aware of, and probably in agreement with, the reasons.


## <a name="company-property"></a>Return of Company Property
Any company property issued to employees, such as documents, computer equipment or company credit cards, must be returned to CivicActions at the time of separation.

## <a name="continuation-benefit"></a>Continuation of Benefits
Cal-COBRA is California law that has similar provisions to federal COBRA. With Cal-COBRA, you will have the benefit of coverage for a full 36 months.


Many other states have “mini-COBRAs” which serve the same purpose as Cal-COBRA. If you live in one of those states, you have the option of using the benefits provided by that state instead of (not in addition to) Cal-COBRA. Cal-COBRA is by far the most generous; however, it is also the most expensive.


This guide covers the offboarding policy and process.

## Offboarding process

`Duplicate` the `Template` in the [Off-Boarding Tasks](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IlFY5AAvTyuS7yDHk5_odJGHYZDU_MN9HNGKJ2zXwi0/edit#gid=0) to make a checklist. More detail for certain tasks is below. Note that, per GSA policy, the "technical offboardings" (access to any work system) need to happen within 24 hours of the person ending their work at GSA.

### Supervisor

- Work with the employee to transition the employee's workload to other team members.
- Ensure they complete their last timesheet in Tock.

### Talent Team

- Conduct an exit interview using [these questions](https://docs.google.com/a/gsa.gov/document/d/1PpbxoZhPlW2oQx9grMyPSUDepDTQCNiwYO-D1X2IkJk/edit).
  - Documentation will be kept anonymous.
  - After three samples are gathered, look for trends.

### Ops Team

- Complete the [clearance checklist](https://drive.google.com/a/gsa.gov/file/d/0B2b-_CCBBYvRNGNVWTRjUnpmTVNtUUR6clVJdUt2MFVTNm5j/view?usp=sharing) with the employee.
