# The Nuts and Bolts of Working for CivicActions


# <a name="employ"></a>EMPLOYMENT

## <a name="background-check"></a>Background Checks
As casual as we are in many areas, CivicActions is a responsible, successful, for-profit business and we do apply some standard business practices. For example, we will almost certainly verify prior employment and check professional references. We may confirm your education before making you an offer. It is also possible that a security check may be required by certain clients from time to time. Third-party services may be hired to perform these checks.


## <a name="immigration-law"></a>Immigration Law Compliance
All CivicActions’ employees hired to work in the U.S. need to complete a Form I-9 and produce proof of identity and eligibility to work. These documents will be kept in your confidential electronic personnel file and we will need them as soon as your Employment Agreement is signed.


## <a name="employment-classification"></a>Employment Classifications
CivicActions has established the following Employee Classifications for compensation and benefit purposes only.


Regular Full-Time Employee: An employee who is scheduled to work no less than 40 hours in a work week . The employee is eligible for all employment benefits offered by CivicActions.


Regular Part-Time Employee: An employee who is scheduled to work less than 40 hours in a workweek. Regular part-time employees working at least 30 hours a week are eligible for all employment benefits offered by CivicActions.


Whether an employee is exempt or non-exempt depends on specific, statutory tests. See "Required Stuff" below.  For our purposes, exempt employees don’t get overtime and non-exempt do.


## <a name="employee-reference"></a>Employee References
CivicActions will only confirm employment and provide employment dates and the positions held in response to third parties inquiries.


# <a name="compensate"></a>COMPENSATION

## <a name="pay-period"></a>Pay Periods
The standard workweek for CivicActions is 12:01 a.m. Sunday through midnight the following Saturday. This is only important if you’re a non-exempt employee who is eligible for overtime.


We have semi-monthly pay days. The first pay period is from the first through the fifteenth of the month and the second from the sixteenth through the end of the month.


Paychecks are direct deposited on the 25th day of the month for the first pay period, and on the 10th day of the following month for the second. If the 10th or 25th fall on a Saturday, Sunday or holiday, you will be paid on the preceding business day.

There are no schedules or guaranteed cost of living or salary adjustments.


## <a name="business-expense"></a>Business-Related Expenses
CivicActions will timely reimburse business-related out-of-pocket expenses as long as you submit a receipt.  For multiple expenses, e.g., a business trip, we also will need an expense report which can be found at:

# <a name="workplace-guideline"></a>WORKPLACE GUIDELINES


## <a name="hours-work"></a>Hours of Work
The normal workweek for a full-time employee is forty (40) hours. There are no set days or times of day, but you are expected to be available for and participate in necessary project- related work sessions and discussions.


## <a name="attendance"></a>Attendance / Tardiness
CivicActions trusts its employees. If an employee is unable to work for any reason, we just ask that you make a good faith effort to timely notify CivicActions of an absence or period of unavailability.


# <a name="required"></a>REQUIRED STUFF THAT IS IMPORTANT


## <a name="atwillnotice"></a>At-Will Notice
In the United States, all employment is At-Will. You are not hired for any definite or specified period of time even though your wages are paid regularly. You are an at-will employee of CivicActions and your employment can be terminated at any time, with or without cause and with or without prior notice. Company policy requires all employees to be hired at-will and this policy cannot be changed by any oral modifications. There have been no implied or verbal agreements or promises to you that you will be discharged only under certain circumstances or after certain procedures are followed. There is no implied employment contract created by this Handbook or any other Company document or written or verbal statement or policy


Only authorized management may alter or modify any of the policies in this Employee Handbook with the exception of the “At-Will Employment” provision, which cannot be altered by anybody. Nothing in this handbook is intended to infringe upon employee rights under Section Seven (7) of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA). See http://www.nlrb.gov/national-labor-relations-act if you’re curious about it.


## <a name="reasonable-accomodation"></a>Reasonable Accommodations
It is the policy of CivicActions to comply with all the relevant and applicable provisions of the federal Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), as well as state and local laws concerning the employment of persons with disabilities. CivicActions will not discriminate against any qualified employee or job applicant because of a person’s physical or mental disability with respect to any terms, privileges, or conditions of employment, including but not limited to hiring, advancement, discharge, compensation, and training.


Employees who become disabled should notify administration if the conditions of the disability impair their ability to perform the essential functions of their position. Where necessary and feasible, reasonable accommodations will be made for qualified disabled employees to perform the essential functions of the job in question, as long as the accommodation does not cause CivicActions undue hardship.


## <a name="exempt-non"></a>Exempt v. Non-exempt
Exempt: Employees whose positions meet specific tests established by the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and applicable state law and who are exempt from overtime pay requirements. The basic premise of exempt status is that the exempt employee is to work the hours required to meet his/her work responsibilities. This includes managers and assistant managers as well as designated office personnel.


Non-exempt: Employees whose positions do not meet FLSA and state exemption tests and who are paid a multiple of their regular rate of pay for overtime hours worked.
