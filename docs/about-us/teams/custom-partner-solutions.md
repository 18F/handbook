title: Custom Partner Solutions
---

Custom Partner Solutions is one of the 5 business units within 18F. Using the cross-functional skills of 18F staff, CPS provides federal agencies with custom, user-centric solutions that address a client&rsquo;s unique challenges. We use agile methodology to partner closely with our clients to create lasting impact. 

## What we do 

- We deliver partnerships and solutions that help agencies solve problems. The first step in that process is a thorough exploration of the challenges facing an agency and their users. From there, the solution can be found down any number of different paths. The constant is that 18F will gather the right experts for the job, partner hand-in-hand with an agency team, use agile techniques, and talk with real users throughout the process to make sure we&rsquo;re building the right thing, not just any thing. 
- We also support internal teams working on CPS projects. More specifically, we offer [guidance on engagement management](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BMiE3oln2-pyq4Ht-Q3Z-P_ecQmi980djZgaN6xCNKM/edit#heading=h.ckh5s3gbtn4m) for project teams and have developed tools to help engagement managers ensure success on their projects.

## Projects
There have been a lot of success stories for CPS, like what we did with:

- The [Department of Labor&rsquo;s Wage and Hour Division](), where we scoped a solution and collaborated on an idea in a way that empowered our partners to meet the needs of their users 
- [NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration&rsquo;s Climate Discovery project](), where we did user research and discovery sprints to promote a new digital model that houses information 
- The [U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service]() and their immigration and visa processes, where we improved upon a slow and challenging process for users by reimagining and modernizing a seemingly daunting task 
- The Department of Education&rsquo;s [College Scorecard](), where we built a new site and API to showcase and synthesize data from multiple sources 
- The [Federal Election Commission]() where we helped make data more accessible with user-friendly site and developer tools
- [Communicart]() and [CALC](), where we built web-based tools to streamline internal agency processes

## How we support internal teams
We&rsquo;re your partners. We promise to set you up to succeed in every way we can. We promise to:

## Communication
Three of CPS&rsquo; major tasks are picking projects, providing information to other 18F teams about upcoming or current projects, and supporting existing project teams. All three of these rely on gathering information from across 18F, so often when you&rsquo;ll be hearing from CPS, we&rsquo;ll be asking you for some specific info. This information gathering is critical to smooth CPS operations â€” it helps us help you! Check the list below to see what kind of information we might be asking from you and who your point person is for questions.
