# Joining the Talent Team

Welcome to the 18F Talent team -- we're happy you're here! We've compiled a set of helpful tips to get you started. We'll update this guide as we receive feedback, so don't be shy to share your thoughts.

As per [the org chart](/org-chart), 18F Talent is broken down into small "teams" focused on recruitment, administration, training and development, and product and process. Most of these "teams" are one or two individuals.  Also, a number of previously identified roles have yet to be filled, which means a few people are playing a few key roles during this time.

## <a id="how-we-work">How we work</a>

### <a id="rituals">Rituals</a>

As you'd guess, everyone's weeks looks a little different. That said, there are recurring weekly meetings and commitments we all have on our calendars.

- **Tuesdays:** 18F all hands meeting. Every Tuesday at 12:30 p.m. ET (9:30 a.m. PT), the entire 18F team meets to cover product launches, introductions of new team members, projects we've just taken on, policy changes, and other broadly applicable news.
- **Fridays:** Each Friday at 1:00 pm ET (10:00 am PT), the whole Talent team [meets](https://plus.google.com/hangouts/_/gsa.gov/jennifer-tress?authuser=0) to discuss project status, policy updates, and general talent-specific news. Our huddles typically follow the same format: the Director of Talent will start off with general announcements and reminders. Afterward, team members give quick updates on how projects are going. You don't need to request to be added to the huddle agenda.
- **Once a week:** meet with your lead. Once a week, you'll have a short check-in with your lead at a time that's convenient for both of you.
- **Once or twice a week:** meet with the rest of the group. Our team is moving towards an agile development practice which means most of us meet a few times a week to sync on the current sprint's top priorities.

### <a id="tools">Tools</a>

Here are some common tools we use, how we use them, and how you can get access to them. If you can't find the information you need in the chart below, get in touch with your buddy on the Talent Team; they'll be able to point you in the right direction.

And one more thing: before you start using any new tool that asks for access to files/browser data, please check the [full list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nrdfmL8DNjRJb45N3QZjvX8TeIcHth3Cy0rO5jVIvKo/edit#gid=1) of approved tools.
