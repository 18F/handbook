## <a name="welcome"></a>Welcome to Our Company!

We’re very happy to welcome you to our company. You have joined an organization that has established an outstanding reputation for quality products and services. Credit for this goes to every one of us. We believe you are a very good fit and will benefit from - and thoroughly enjoy - being part of an amazing team.

## <a name="history"></a>Background / History
CivicActions, Inc. is a global professional services firm delivering innovative technology strategy, creative design, and mobile and web development services for the world’s leading progressive non-profits, foundations, socially responsible businesses and, most recently, various Federal and local government agencies. 


CivicActions started in 2004 and is now established as one of the leaders in both the Agile and Drupal communities. We have served over 175 clients including the Center for Reproductive Rights, American Public Media, Amnesty International and the San Francisco Human Services Agency. The work we do allows us to contribute to important causes - promoting sustainability, social justice, human rights and environmental protection. We believe in delivering excellent work, having fun doing it, surrounding ourselves with super people and creating opportunities to learn and grow. We also believe in nurturing a lifestyle that allows each of our team members to create a balanced, impactful life.

## <a name="purpose"></a>Handbook Purpose
This Handbook has been prepared to tell you about CivicActions’ philosophy, employment practices, policies, benefits, and the conduct we expect from ourselves. 


CivicActions operates transparently on a fundamental level. We have very few “rules and regulations.” We expect everyone, individually and collectively, to be forthright, trustworthy, ethical and have a sense of humor. Because we expect it, we attract people who demonstrate exactly these qualities. Left to our own devices, this Handbook would be very short - be open, do your best, ask for help and clarification when you need it, and have fun. 


That being said, there are topics in this document that are required by law or at least by HR professionals. You will find them further down under “Required Stuff.” This Handbook is not designed to answer specific questions or address specific scenarios. It is more likely to be a springboard for conversations that will allow us to express our views, get to know each other better, and continually improve harmonious relationships. Issues are addressed on a case-by-case basis anyway. We do want you to feel free to discuss anything with team members and/or management, whether it’s something that disturbs you, something that confuses you or something that excites you.   You will find CivicActions a great place to work.
