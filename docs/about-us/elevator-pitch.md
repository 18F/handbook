# CivicActions' Elevator Pitch

Are you prepared for the "so, what does _your_ company do" questions? Having an elevator pitch in mind is useful, not just for conferences, but also for every day networking.

Think about when you're just at a gathering and you're excited about your new job and someone asks you to tell them more... what will you say? Don't sweat, be prepared!

Here's a sample:
>CivicActions is a full-service software and Drupal development and design firm focused on transforming federal, state and local government. We also lead the effort behind Agile Government Leadership (AGL), which brings together public sector IT leaders to help understand and implement Agile project management practices within government.

Some points to keep in mind:
- We work to transform government with free and open technologies and agile processes.
- We support public sector IT leaders in understanding and implementing Agile project management practices within government (AGL).
- We're on a rocket ship of growth, we have an amazing company culture, and we're looking for new team members to join the party!
