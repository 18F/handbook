## The building

<a href="http://civichall.org/">Civic Hall</a> is a coworking space dedicated to civic tech. There are only two rules as far as we can tell:

1. Be an adult
2. Don't go into the event space unless you're attending an event

## <a id="getting-here"></a>Getting here

### <a id="from-the-airport"></a>From the airport

From JFK, there are various public transit options depending on when you land. [Check this map](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/John+F.+Kennedy+International+Airport,+New+York,+NY+11430/Civic+Hall,+5th+Avenue,+New+York,+NY/@40.7044409,-73.9560713,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c26650d5404947:0xec4fb213489f11f0!2m2!1d-73.7781391!2d40.6413111!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c259a3a3340f3d:0xba4060a01c13cc2a!2m2!1d-73.9910784!2d40.7399033!3e3) to determine which is the fastest method.

From LaGuardia, it&rsquo;s probably best to take a cab or car service. If you&rsquo;re traveling light and feel adventurous, there are a couple buses that connect to the subway, such as the Q70 and Q48. Eventually there will be a rail connection, we&rsquo;re told.

### <a id="walking"></a>Walking

Civic Hall is at a fairly central location in Manhattan, close to a lot of public transportation.

### <a id="biking"></a>Biking

There is no designated bike parking at Civic Hall, but you can lock your bike outside the building.

### <a id="public-transit"></a>Public transit

Civic Hall is close to a number of Subway stops (F/M/N/R at 23rd, 1 at 18th, or the N/Q/R/4/5/6 at Union Square). See the [Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) website](http://www.mta.info/) for additional information.

### <a id="parking"></a>Parking

There are public garages available in the area, but on-the-street parking is highly limited. We recommend public transit.

## <a id="how-do-i"></a>How do I...

### <a id="enter-the-building"></a>Enter the building for the first time?

Head up to the second floor. Sign in at the front desk, listing your organization as 18F. That's it. We've taken to sitting at the desks with the big monitors: if you go through the front door, make two lefts.

### <a id="get-my-fingerprints"></a>Get my fingerprints and badge?

Badge/fingerprints are not needed for access to Civic Hall. Information on getting your fingerprints and badge at One World Trade will be added soon.

### <a id="after-hours"></a>Access the building after hours?

Civic Hall is open 8:30am-7pm Monday-Friday, 10am-5:00pm Saturday, and 12pm-5:00pm Sunday. There is no access outside these times. Note: Civic Hall is closed on weekends from Memorial Day through Labor Day

### <a id="book-rooms"></a>Book rooms for meetings?

1. Go to [http://civichall.spaces.nexudus.com/en](http://civichall.spaces.nexudus.com/en)
2. Click `Booking Calendar`, then click the `Make a booking` button.

You can book large rooms for meetings, but Phone Rooms can also be booked for calls and/or meetings with 2-3 in person attendees. 

Note: You will need to have a Civic Hall membership to book a room. If you're visiting NYC, post in #nyc to have someone here book your room with their log in.

### <a id="printers"></a>Printers

Refer to [our printer information document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ikw7kfeY10lnImZHN7zq5wNjaTRBdTPkZj4QG7-z3d0/edit#) for more details.

### <a id="get-on-the-wireless"></a>Get on the wireless?

The Civic Hall wireless network and password are posted at the front desk and on the walls throughout the space.

## <a id="where-are-the"></a>Where are the...

### <a id="bathroom-keys"></a>Bathrooms

Facing the main space, turn right out of reception. Follow the hallway all the way to the back, signs will guide you.

### Mother’s rooms

There isn’t a dedicated room, but Civic Hall recommends using Phone Room 3, because it is tucked away and locks. Ask the person at the front desk for the laminated window covering. They also have a “pumping in progress, privacy please” sign for the other phone rooms, but people may walk in on you.

### <a id="snacks"></a>Snacks and drinks

You can get coffee, espresso, cappuccinos, tea, and water in the kitchen free of charge. There are also often snacks for general consumption (they will be clearly labelled as such).

### <a id="spare-keyboards-mice"></a>Spare keyboards and mice

If you need office supplies, ask in [#teamops](https://18f.slack.com/messages/teamops/). They will likely send you to [https://cap.18f.gov](https://cap.18f.gov/) to order the supplies.

If you need a cord to connect to one of the monitors in the space (or to a conference room set up) ask at the front desk. They also have chargers!

## <a id="transit-subsidy"></a>Transit subsidy

All GSA employees are eligible for transit subsidies which cover the cost of your MTA travel. To receive a transit subsidy, fill out [GSA form 3675](http://www.gsa.gov/portal/forms/download/115174).

### Get your card

In region 2 (that&rsquo;s us!) the transit benefit comes on a prepaid debit card that you can use to add money to a your MetroCard. Fill out and sign both pages of the application; the second page shows how you calculated what you are asking for. After you&rsquo;re done, send it to your supervisor to sign and return to you.

The bank that processes region 2 subsidies (Chase) requires one more piece of information that is not on the form: your Service Computation Date. If you are a new federal employee, this is the Sunday before the first day you showed up at 18F. If you are continuing from a previous federal job, it is the day you started that job. You can find that date on [Employee Express](https://www.employeeexpress.gov/).

Email the completed form to Benjamin Zabava at [ben.zabava@gsa.gov](mailto:ben.zabava@gsa.gov), and cc Victor Valdiviezo ([victor.valdiviezo@gsa.gov](mailto:victor.valdiviezo@gsa.gov)). Include your service computation date in the email. He will tell you when a transit card has arrived for you and is available to pick up at his desk in room 1655. It can take about a week.

### Register your card

Register online at [https://ucard.chase.com/](https://ucard.chase.com/). Despite what the instructions say on the document that comes with your card, choose `Register`, not `Activate`. For work phone number, don't enter your own phone number — instead, enter the phone number of your regional coordinator (which is the R2 coordinator phone number in [this Point of Contact list](https://insite.gsa.gov/portal/content/510262)) and office ZIP code (10278). If you have trouble, call the number in the error message on the website. Select `3` on the main menu, then press `0` to speak to a customer service representative.

### Use your card

Although it is technically a debit card, when you put the card in an MTA machine, select `Credit Card` as your payment method, and use the same office ZIP code. The balance resets on the 10th of every month. The new balance is intended to cover the following month&rsquo;s transit, but you can use it at any time.

## <a id="nyc-events"></a>NYC events

We have a team breakfast every Tuesday morning in the Civic Hall cafe (BYOB - bring your own breakfast) and a happy hour outing the first Thursday of every month. Both are optional, but lots of fun. Ask to be added to the invite in #nyc.


## <a id="who-works-here"></a>Who works here?

You can find everyone who works in the NYC office [here](https://pages.18f.gov/team-browser/?locations=NYC).
