{% comment %}
This is the primary layout. It is separated out in the event that we eventually
want other kinds of pages with the same base setup (banner, header, search,
footer, etc.).

<main id="main-content" class="usa-prose">
  {% if title %}
    <h1 page-title>{{ title }}</h1>
  {% endif %}

  {% include "page-outdated.html" %}

    {% include "travel-alert.html" %}
  {% endif %}
