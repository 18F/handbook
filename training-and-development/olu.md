The GSA [Online University (OLU)](https://gsaolu.gsa.gov/) is the home for mandatory trainings, as well as a repository of recommended and optional training opportunities, for GSA employees.

## Online University (OLU) classes

Required classes will be assigned in OLU and pushed individually to the OLU home page of TTS employees under **My Learning Assignments**.

Time spent taking OLU trainings should be coded as `969 - GSA-mandated Non-Billable Work` in [Tock]({{site.baseurl}}/tock).

_GSA OLU training material sometimes has trouble with certain browsers. We recommend using [Citrix]({{site.baseurl}}/virtual-desktop) and Internet Explorer or, on Mac, Safari, to ensure successful course completion and documentation._
