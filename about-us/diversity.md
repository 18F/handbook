At TTS, [our mission]({{site.baseurl}}/tts-history/) is to design and deliver a digital government with and for the American public. To ensure that the products we build and services we offer truly serve everyone, we center our work on diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility (also known as DEIA). In particular, we align our efforts with recent Executive Orders on [DEIA in the federal workforce](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/06/25/executive-order-on-diversity-equity-inclusion-and-accessibility-in-the-federal-workforce/) and [advancing racial equity through government services](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/20/executive-order-advancing-racial-equity-and-support-for-underserved-communities-through-the-federal-government/).

## Our approach to DEIA

We believe that diversity is vital to a successful organization and that we must reflect the diversity of the public we serve. We also recognize that [a diverse workforce is not enough](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/diversity-and-inclusion/). We are committed to promoting an inclusive environment where we celebrate what brings us together and makes us unique.  To that end, we believe DEIA is a people-centric, collective effort and that one employee is enough to merit change.

## Code of Conduct

The foundation for the Diversity Guild’s work is based on the [TTS Code of Conduct]({{site.baseurl}}/code-of-conduct/).

We strive to create a community where everyone feels empowered to speak up. However, we recognize that there are always power dynamics at play and that each of us has personal preferences when discussing sensitive information. If you would like to discuss an issue without disclosing your name, [please use this anonymous form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe9OrJBE19gzeAA42lOF3GmEkXrcXuf0g6KqXeP-wCZRO0_Vw/viewform).

## Resources

We actively work to eliminate bigotry and subtle forms of disrespect (e.g. microaggressions, microinvalidations, etc.) from our workplace. We also understand that in order to address [unconscious bias](https://diversity.ucsf.edu/resources/unconscious-bias) you have to start somewhere. Below are resources for anyone to learn more about diversity and inclusion principles and best-practices.

- [18F Inclusive Language Guide](https://content-guide.18f.gov/inclusive-language/) - principles, resources, and suggestions for writing and talking about diverse groups of people.
- Preference, Tradition, or Requirement? [“Here’s EY’s Simple But Effective Strategy For Increasing Diversity”](https://fortune.com/2017/02/10/ey-simple-effective-diversity-inclusiveness-strategy/) - Is something a preference, tradition, or requirement? This article covers how Ernst and Young used the “PTR” framework to hire a more diverse workforce. It can be used widely to critically assess all aspects of a work culture.
- [One on One Meeting Framework](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GAhgY2y1usPhU7UN-w08ZDNXFTC6aWBKFBYRRxgjvWk/edit) - This GSA resource - though not explicitly written with a diversity and inclusion lens - contains useful guidelines that supervisors can use to provide equitable feedback experiences with each employee on a regular basis.
- [Management Tools list from The Management Center](http://www.managementcenter.org/tools/) - includes resources on delegation, roles & goals, performance problems, managing up, and much more. They include equity and inclusion considerations in their tools.

## Approach

We believe there are four sources of inclusiveness at every organization, and we work to align our organization to these principles.

**1. Organizational level: Practices and activities that contribute to, or detract from, an inclusive organization.**

- Formal communications (mission statement, strategy, annual reports, etc.) reflect a commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion.
- Diversity, equity, and inclusion are part of the core values of senior leadership and are treated as priorities.
- There are transparent and equitable processes around interviews, hiring, promotions, salaries, training approvals, and evaluations. Additionally, there are systems in place to regularly re-examine and remove any potential bias in these processes.
- There are clearly communicated ways to support individual employees, including mentorship, development plans, and advancement opportunities.
- There is accountability and action when issues arise.

**2. Management: The support you receive from your managers - this includes program managers, leads, and/or supervisors.**

- Your manager is reliable, ethical, and transparent.
- Your manager includes you in discussions, and you feel like an invaluable member of the team.
- Your manager models the importance of creating strong, supportive teams.
- Your manager acknowledges the power dynamics that are created with managerial titles and does their best to make interactions more fair and balanced.
- Your manager creates an environment that feels safe for you to bring your whole self to work and upholds strong expectations that everyone else does the same.
- Your manager serves as an advocate and supports you in your professional growth.
- Your manager has challenging conversations when needed and approaches them with respect and empathy.

**3. Work-group level: Day-to-day interpersonal relationships and the team climate.**

- Your coworkers treat you as an insider to decision-making, respect your opinions, value you, and emphasize that you belong on the team.
- Your uniqueness is celebrated, and you do not feel the need to assimilate in order to fit in.
- You are treated as a valued participant to interpersonal and group learning.

**4. Individual level: The contributions you make that affect inclusion and awareness of diversity.**

- You share decision-making and power with your colleagues.
- You take the time to build relationships with colleagues on a personal level.
- You are mindful of your actions and words and take responsibility for the impact they have on others.
- You put in the work to educate yourself around subjects you are unfamiliar with before asking someone to educate you.
- You acknowledge your privilege and balance listening and supporting colleagues.
- You are an ally and use your voice to advocate for those who are overlooked or interrupted.
- You practice empathy and approach situations with curiosity rather than defensiveness — you try to understand where someone else is coming from.
- You recognize that it’s ok to disagree with others, and you practice respectful discourse.
- You treat yourself with kindness. Mistakes happen; you apologize and grow from them.

## Diversity Guild

The Diversity [Guild]({{site.baseurl}}/working-groups-and-guilds-101/) is a formal, on-going way for employees to share experiences, resources, and learn from one another via weekly meetings and the [\#g-diversity](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/messages/g-diversity/) Slack channel.

The Guild is currently led by Aileen McGraw and Jessyka Castillo.

We also have [DE&I Reps](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g7bpwFBfpHMy0guu5nUaF0HhBLvu42pF0nCiBdb92M4/edit) from each part of the organization.

### How to get involved

Not only does the Diversity Guild provide a space for learning, it also promotes the belief in sharing what you’ve learned. The group also tries to provide insight on how TTS currently integrates DEI and could better integrate DEI principles at every point: from recruitment, interviewing, and onboarding, all the way to terming out, leaving the organization, or even returning to TTS.
