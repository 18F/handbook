**Mission:** Design and deliver a digital government with and for the American public.

**Vision:** Trusted modern government experiences for all.

## Our history

<!--StartFragment-->

The roots of the Technology Transformation Services reach back to 1966 and a nationwide network of 26 Federal Information Centers that people could visit in person for answers to government questions. Over the next four decades, those information centers would add numerous responsibilities and change names a number of times before becoming what is now known as Solutions, [after a few iterations]({{site.baseurl}}/office-of-solutions/history/).

## <!--StartFragment-->

While Solutions was paving the way for government shared services and open data, there was a growing need to bring new technology talent into the government. In 2012, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy [created](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2012/08/23/white-house-launches-presidential-innovation-fellows-program) the [Presidential Innovation Fellows (PIF)](https://presidentialinnovationfellows.gov/) program to unite private-sector innovators from across America with federal innovators to tackle projects that fuel job creation, save taxpayers money, and improve the lives of the public in tangible ways. The next year, the PIF program found a permanent home at GSA, which enabled the program to grow its reach and impact with even more federal agency partners. GSA and a group of PIFs began exploring how they, and a new generation of civic technologists, could extend human-centered innovation even further. In early 2014, PIF alumni became GSA employees and [co-founded a design and development studio](https://18f.gsa.gov/2014/09/18/getting-to-work-for-the-american-people/). This studio worked like a lean startup inside the U.S. government.

That project became [18F](https://18f.gsa.gov/) when the office officially launched in March 2014. 18F quickly grew in size to help federal agencies work on technology projects while learning new skills. In June 2016, 18F, PIF, and Solutions came together. In 2017, TTS added the [IT Modernization Centers of Excellence (CoEs)](https://coe.gsa.gov/) to focus on whole-agency technology modernization, and all of TTS moved into GSA’s existing Federal Acquisition Service (FAS), as the Technology Transformation Services (TTS).
