We use [Federalist](https://federalist.18f.gov) to build websites.

## Documentation

- [Federalist Documentation](https://federalist.18f.gov/documentation/)

## Setup

- Set up your [GitHub]({{site.baseurl}}/github/) account.
- Request access in the [#federalist-support](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/messages/federalist-support) channel. If approved, an administrator will send you an invitation to the federalist-users group in GitHub.
- Log in at the [Federalist app](https://federalistapp.18f.gov/).

## Rules

- TTS teams can use Federalist for internal or TTS-specific projects without cost. However, if the site is part of a project you're doing for another agency, it must be included in and paid for by the agreement with that agency.

- For 18F staff only - The Outreach team is responsible for 18F's web presence. If you are looking to create an 18F microsite (`xyz.18f.gov`), such as a guide or resource, the Outreach team will need to approve it. _Where to start:_ Tell us about the site that you want to create by [filling out this form](https://goo.gl/forms/gnknCoYSRIF0gGrA3). If you have any questions, head over to [#outreach](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/messages/outreach/) on Slack.
