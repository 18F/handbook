[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) is a package manager and cloud-based registry for
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). The npm registry can be used to package and
distribute JavaScript libraries and programs for software development.

## How do I publish npm packages for TTS?

Any npm packages published for work should be published under the
[18f](https://www.npmjs.com/org/18f) npm organization. You may use your personal
npm account for membership to the 18f organization. Ask
[#javascript](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/archives/C032KSPPQ) for how to get
membership or a token for publishing.

## For admins

Login with your npm account and remove the user from the [18f organization](https://www.npmjs.com/settings/18f/members).
