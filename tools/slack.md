Slack is a chat client that provides us with a centralized way to communicate without overloading our inboxes. You can [login online](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/) or download the [desktop](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/slack/id803453959?mt=12) or [mobile](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/slack-team-communication/id618783545?mt=8) clients from the App Store.

This page overviews how to get setup with Slack at TTS and covers some best practices.

## How to make an announcement in #news

Use #news for vital team announcements. [#news](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/archives/news) is an announcement-only channel where only administrators can post. If you have a post you'd like to go up in #news:

- **18F employees** ping @commsquad or post in [#outreach](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/archives/news) to get a review of the language. Once it's ready, Dahianna Salazar Foreman can post it.
- **Acquisitions employees** review your post with Stephen Reilly, and he can post it when it's ready.
- **OPP employees** review your post with Jeremy Zilar or John Yuda; one of them can post it when it's ready.
- **PIF employees** review your post with Joshua Di Frances, and he can post it when it's ready.

Please keep #news posts limited to information that the entire team needs to know. This includes things like:

- Major events impacting all of TTS or a TTS Business unit
- Required trainings
- Necessary security and compliance actions
- Policy changes or reminders
- All-team events
- Senior management team meeting notes
- Changes or actions that impact the entire team

## Groups

Slack Groups allow you to direct messages to a specific list of people in a more precise way than an **@-channel** or **@-here**. Any full member can [view, create, and edit Slack groups](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/212906697-User-Groups) at will.

Groups are a great way to alert people who might not be in a channel about something that needs their attention or make sure urgent incidents are directed to the right people and not an entire channel. For example, you can ping **@github-admins** in #admins-github if you have an urgent issue instead of using an **@channel** or use **@federalist-team** to alert that group of a conversation in another channel that we should see immediately.

## Connectivity issues

If you are having connectivity issues with Slack, see the [Slack status site](https://status.slack.com/) for more information, and move to [Hangouts Chat](https://support.google.com/a/users/answer/9300511?hl=en) or email.
