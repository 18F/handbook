Slack offers a feature to create [shared channels with other workspaces](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/115004151203-Create-shared-channels-on-a-workspace-beta-). Shared channels are a more efficient and economic way to work with people in other Slack workspaces than managing them in our Slack workspace as guests, especially when using multiple channels for a project. All records in shared channels are [retained and available for Corporate Exports](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/204897248-Guide-to-Slack-import-and-export-tools).

## Guidance for using shared channels

When participating in shared channels, please keep in mind:

- While people in similar organizations share areas of focus, we should treat our collaborators in these channels as **members of the public** and only share information we would put into public channels. Anything said in those channels is a public announcement and could end up posted on twitter by someone else, for example. This does not apply to shared channels with an active agreement between us and the people in the other workspace.

- Nothing about a shared Slack channel itself implies a partnership between TTS and the other organization. The shared channel just adds another possible route of communication to e-mail, twitter, listserves, and so on. Do not feel obligated to answer a DM from someone in a shared channel.

- We should not mention the Slack orgs of our partners in public channels or to other agencies without permission. It's not for us as TTS to share which other groups in gov are using Slack, nor do we want to appear to be endorsing its use for others.

- For all shared and public channels, it's not a good idea to invite people into a shared channel that aren't there. Instead, DM them the link to an interesting message. Pulling them in without their consent (where others can @ or DM them) may not be fair to their schedule if they need to be heads down.

Likewise, when setting up shared channels, we will look to set these expectations with workspaces with which we connect:

- Members of our team in shared channels may not have a lot of time to respond to DMs from partner orgs. Requests for documents, materials, and etc are better placed in the open channel for anyone to see and triage.

- Members of our team will only want to share materials that are already public. If you have a specific request for a private document, that request is better e-mailed than put into Slack, as that e-mail will have to be sent around to various GSA offices to ensure compliance.

- Anyone in a shared channel must also comply with GSA standards and the [TTS Code of Conduct]({{site.baseurl}}/code-of-conduct).

If a shared channel does not produce good results, or causes a burden, we don't need to continue it. That won't be the end of our collaboration - just recognizing that a particular tool isn't effective for achieving the results that we want. If the shared channel is with a private entity (contractor or vendor) we will not continue sharing a channel after the agreement covering our work elapses.

## Requesting a new shared channel

When you are interested in a shared channel, please drop into [#admins-slack](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/messages/C02KW46DP) to request it. Please specify if you want to use a new channel or want us to share an existing channel. Please also give us a heads up before partners send us a sharing request.
