title: External collaboration through Slack

## External collaborators

Collaborators may include:

- Vendors _under contract_ (not just a Terms of Service) with TTS
- Vendors with GSA who are working on a project with TTS, for which we have an Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)
- Partners at federal agencies whose projects are under an Interagency Agreement with TTS, or at state or local agencies whose projects are under an Intergovernmental Collaboration Act agreement with TTS.

Note this does _not_ include:

- The general public, for which we have [dedicated channels](#public-channels)
- Other feds who we are not working with directly

Contractors' level of access will be determined by the Contracting Officer (CO). By default, **contractors who are "embedded" in TTS (working on TTS projects most or full-time) can be added as full members, while other collaborators should be added as single or multi-channel guests**, as appropriate.

Additonal exceptions, including a small number of close TTS collaborators at GSA, may be added as full Slack members at the discretion of the Technology Director. Examples might include the Chief Information Officer or FAS Commissioner. Ask in [#admins-slack](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/messages/admins-slack) if you'd like to add someone to this category.

### Partner-specific channels

You may want to invite partners, contractors, etc. to specific project channels to foster collaboration and asynchronous communication with the team. Projects often [create](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/201402297-Creating-a-channel) specific channels that end with `-partners`.

1. [Create a `<project>-partners` channel](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/201402297-Creating-a-channel), if you don't want them in an existing channel.
1. Fill out the [user request form](https://docs.google.com/a/gsa.gov/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfYQ-D82rIGwbCmwF3kAQERqczi5syVGq6GtmQNR6fhxRAA2Q/viewform).

## Slack Connect

Slack offers a feature to create [shared channels with other workspaces](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/115004151203-Create-shared-channels-on-a-workspace-beta-). Shared channels are a more efficient and economic way to work with people in other Slack workspaces than managing them in our Slack workspace as guests, especially when using multiple channels for a project. All records in shared channels are [retained and available for Corporate Exports](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/204897248-Guide-to-Slack-import-and-export-tools).

### Guidance for using shared channels

When participating in shared channels, please keep in mind:

- While people in similar organizations share areas of focus, we should treat our collaborators in these channels as **members of the public** and only share information we would put into public channels. Anything said in those channels is a public announcement and could end up posted on twitter by someone else, for example. This does not apply to shared channels with an active agreement between us and the people in the other workspace.

- Nothing about a shared Slack channel itself implies a partnership between TTS and the other organization. The shared channel just adds another possible route of communication to e-mail, twitter, listserves, and so on. Do not feel obligated to answer a DM from someone in a shared channel.

- We should not mention the Slack orgs of our partners in public channels or to other agencies without permission. It's not for us as TTS to share which other groups in gov are using Slack, nor do we want to appear to be endorsing its use for others.

- For all shared and public channels, it's not a good idea to invite people into a shared channel that aren't there. Instead, DM them the link to an interesting message. Pulling them in without their consent (where others can @ or DM them) may not be fair to their schedule if they need to be heads down.

Likewise, when setting up shared channels, we will look to set these expectations with workspaces with which we connect:

- Members of our team in shared channels may not have a lot of time to respond to DMs from partner orgs. Requests for documents, materials, and etc are better placed in the open channel for anyone to see and triage.

- Members of our team will only want to share materials that are already public. If you have a specific request for a private document, that request is better e-mailed than put into Slack, as that e-mail will have to be sent around to various GSA offices to ensure compliance.

- Anyone in a shared channel must also comply with GSA standards and the [TTS Code of Conduct]({{site.baseurl}}/code-of-conduct).

If a shared channel does not produce good results, or causes a burden, we don't need to continue it. That won't be the end of our collaboration - just recognizing that a particular tool isn't effective for achieving the results that we want. If the shared channel is with a private entity (contractor or vendor) we will not continue sharing a channel after the agreement covering our work elapses.

### Requesting a new shared channel

When you are interested in a shared channel, please drop into [#admins-slack](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/messages/C02KW46DP) to request it. Please specify if you want to use a new channel or want us to share an existing channel. Please also give us a heads up before partners send us a sharing request.

## Public channels

[TTS](https://www.gsa.gov/portal/category/25729) has specific channels in Slack that are open to the public to join. These channels end with `-public`. (Note: In Slack's parlance, all channels in a workspace are either `public`, allowing any full member to find/join, or `private`. However, when we say "public channels" on this page, we mean channels open to all members of the public.)

Friends with `.gov`/`.mil` email addresses who aren't collaborating on a project can be invited into public channels. Fill out the [user request form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfYQ-D82rIGwbCmwF3kAQERqczi5syVGq6GtmQNR6fhxRAA2Q/viewform?usp=sf_link).

Treat these public channels like you would a livestreamed event on GSA's YouTube page or other type of public meeting open to guests. Materials and documents should not be shared only in public channels; instead, they should be published on TTS websites and then linked to from the public channels so that access to Slack isn't required to see the document.

Members of the public must also comply with GSA standards and the [TTS Code of Conduct]({{site.baseurl}}/code-of-conduct).

For all shared and public channels, it's not a good idea to invite people into a shared channel that aren't there without a heads up. Instead, please DM them the link to an interesting message. Pulling them in without their consent (where others can @ or DM them) may not be fair to their schedule if they need to be heads down.

To invite people to a public Slack channel, send them to [chat.18f.gov](https://chat.18f.gov/) and have them select the appropriate channel from the drop-down. Note that these users are added as [**single-channel** guests](https://slack.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/201314026-Understanding-roles-permissions-inside-Slack).

### Add a new public channel

See [the instructions](https://github.com/18F/chat#adding-new-public-channels).

## Usage of other Slack workspaces

You may be invited to other Slack workspaces operated by government entities, or entities under contract to the government. You're allowed to join those workspaces as necessary for your work. You should join those workspaces with your **government email address** and ensure your avatar and profile information are consistent across Slack workspaces. If you're invited to Slack workspaces unrelated to your job, you must join those workspaces with a personal email address.
