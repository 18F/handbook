Visual designers often need [Creative Cloud (CC)](https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud.html) for access to high-powered vector control in Illustrator, image editing in Photoshop, print layout in InDesign, or video-editing tools. You can request either:

- Acrobat Pro
- Photoshop
- The full Creative Cloud Suite

by submitting [a Software Request through the GSA IT Help Desk](https://gsa.servicenowservices.com/sp/?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=1bfdfdca78d3a400ce3ddff91a64940b). Make sure to specify that you are on a Mac. Note that licenses are limited, so please don't request access unless you really do need it for your work.
