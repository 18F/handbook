[Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software) provides chat capabilities similar to Slack, with the ability to collaborate around themed channels, direct messaging to multiple individuals, etc. Microsoft Teams may be the collaborative tool of choice for partners that have adopted Microsoft services.

GSA does not provide Microsoft Teams to staff, but [as an authorized tool at a partner agency, GSA staff may use the partner's Teams for collaborating with them]({{site.baseurl}}/collaboration-tools/#using-partners-tools).
