We use Gmail for email.

## Usage

You can access your email from <https://mail.google.com> or <https://email.gsa.gov>.

## Tips

- **For basic Gmail tips and best practices** check out the [Email with Gmail](https://insite.gsa.gov/portal/content/638210) InSite page.

- **Enable clickable `mailto:` links in Chrome**:

  1. Navigate to your inbox, https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox, and click on the interlocking diamonds icon on the right in your address bar.
  2. In the dialog, _Allow mail.google.com to open all email links._
  3. Then click _Done_, as show below:

  You can read more about Chrome's protocol handlers at [The Complete Guide to Google Chrome Handlers](https://www.ashout.com/complete-guide-to-google-chrome-handlers/).

- **If you go by a different name:**

  - You can create an alias to have a different email address if you go by something other than your legal name. [Submit a "GSA Generic Request"](https://gsa.servicenowservices.com/sp/?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=7a09e6672b523000a6e7a73319da1554) asking for the email alias that you want.
  - The alias will change the name in your email address, but not the name in your profile. It's just a few extra steps to [change your profile name]({{ site.baseurl }}/changing-your-name/).

- [**Create filters**](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/6579) to manage the influx of automatic emails you’ll be receiving (like Region X Communications). You can select "add a label" and automatically “archive" or put messages into different folders.

- **You can set your photo** for your Google profile in [Gmail settings](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/35529?hl=en).
