At TTS, [Google Docs/Sheets/Slides]({{site.baseurl}}/google-drive/) is our preferred tool for documents/spreadsheets/presentations, since it has built-in records retention, collaboration, sharing, importing and exporting of Office files, etc.

In normal day-to-day operations, working on projects for GSA, you will probably never need Microsoft Office. The most common case for needing Office is if another agency is unable to use web-based productivity tools like GSA's G Suite.

If you only need Office temporarily, you can access it right away through [VDI](https://vdi.anywhere.gsa.gov). To get a license on your machine, you will need to put in a request.

## Requesting a license

1. [Open a Software request through ServiceNow](https://gsa.servicenowservices.com/sp/?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=1bfdfdca78d3a400ce3ddff91a64940b)
1. For `Software Name`, select `Office ProPlus`
